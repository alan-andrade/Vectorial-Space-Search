correlation between maternal and fetal plasma levels of glucose and free
fatty acids .                                                           
  correlation coefficients have been determined between the levels of   
glucose and ffa in maternal and fetal plasma collected at delivery .    
significant correlations were obtained between the maternal and fetal   
glucose levels and the maternal and fetal ffa levels . from the size of 
the correlation coefficients and the slopes of regression lines it      
appears that the fetal plasma glucose level at delivery is very strongly
dependent upon the maternal level whereas the fetal ffa level at        
delivery is only slightly dependent upon the maternal level .

changes of the nucleic acid and phospholipid levels of the livers in the
course of fetal and postnatal development .                             
  we have followed the evolution of dna, rna and pl in the livers of rat
foeti removed between the fifteenth and the twenty-first day of         
gestation and of young rats newly-born or at weaning . we can observe   
the following facts..                                                   
  1. dna concentration is 1100 ug p on the 15th day, it decreases from  
the 19th day until it reaches a value of 280 ug 5 days after weaning .  
  2. rna concentration is 1400 ug p on the 15th day and decreases to 820
during the same period .                                                
  3. pl concentration is low on the 15th day and during foetal life (700
ug) and increases abruptly at birth .                                   
  4. the ratios rna cyto/dna and pl cyto/dna increase regularly from the
18th day of foetal life .                                               
  5. nuclear rna and pl contents are very high throughout the           
development .                                                           
  6. these results enable us to characterize three stages in the        
development of the rat liver.. - from the 15th day to the 18th day of   
foetal life.. stage of growth through hyperplasia without hypertrophy,  
  - from the 19th day of foetal life to the 3rd day of post-natal life,.
stage of cellular reorganisation,                                       
  - after the 3rd day of post-natal life.. stage of growth through      
hyperplasia and hypertrophy .

surfactant in fetal lamb tracheal fluid .                               
  lambs delivered by cesarean section with intact fetal circulation have
a fluid filling the trachea . analysis revealed that this fluid         
contained material high in surface activity in lambs delivered near     
term, but less surface activity in premature lambs .                    
  administration of 10 per cent oxygen to the ewe for 1 hour prior to   
delivery did not alter the surfactant properties of the fetal tracheal  
fluid .                                                                 
  two analyses of the fetal tracheal fluid revealed it to contain 146   
and 198 mg. of lipid per 100 ml., 30 to 40 per cent of which was        
phospholipid, part of the active component of surfactant .              
  the investigations reported here offer a model for further research   
into possible intrauterine factors in the pathogenesis of hyaline       
membrane disease .

placental and cord blood lipids.. comparison in a set of double ovum    
twins, a stillborn and a live-born .                                    
  1. determinations of phospholipid, total and free cholesterol,        
triglyceride and nefa have been made on placental tissue and cord blood 
in a set of double ovum twins, one stillborn and one live-born .        
  2. similarities occurred in all fractions studied except the cord     
blood triglyceride and nefa levels .                                    
  3. the serum of the stillborn infant contained one-third as much      
triglyceride and 21/2 times as much nefa as did the live-born infant .  
  4. the phospholipid content and the total lipid content of the        
stillbirth placenta were the highest studied in this laboratory which   
includes determinations on 26 live births .                             
  5. the suggestion is made that increased lipoprotein lipase activity  
in the cord blood may accompany intrauterine fetal death .

free fatty acid concentration in maternal plasma and fetal body fat     
content .                                                               
  subcutaneous injection of 200 u.s.p. units of heparin into female     
sprague-dawley rats produced large and sustained elevations of plasma   
free fatty acids but no significant change in blood glucose . a group of
pregnant rats received such injections of heparin 3 times daily         
throughout pregnancy . the fetuses from mothers of this group, at 191/2 
and 211/2 days of gestation, had significantly more body fat than the   
fetuses from uninjected mothers . the hypothesis is presented that the  
maternal free fatty acid concentration in part determines fetal fat     
accumulation . it is proposed that the body composition changes noted in
babies of mothers with diabetes might thus be ascribed to abnormally    
high maternal plasma free fatty acid concentrations .

the concentration of non-esterified fatty acids in maternal and fetal   
plasma in intact, alloxan-diabetic and x-ray-irradiated rats .          
  determinations of the non-esterified fatty acids in the plasma of     
pregnant rats showed that there do not exist any increases in the       
concentrations depending on pregnancy during the period from the 20th - 
22nd day of pregnancy . in the fetal plasma the concentrations of       
non-esterified fatty acids only amounted to 40 - 50 per cent of the     
maternal values .                                                       
  with alloxan diabetes produced 2 days prior to the test the           
concentration in the maternal plasma increased three- to fivefold, while
at the same time a significant rise was absent in fetal plasma with     
slightly increased average values .                                     
  whole-body x-ray exposures (dose.. 400r, dose output.. 40r/min) of    
non-pregnant female and of pregnant rats beginning on the 17th day of   
pregnancy did not result in any changes of the concentration of         
non-esterified fatty acids immediately after irradiation .

lipid metabolism in toxemia and normal pregnancy .                      
  the amount and fatty acid composition of total lipid extract from     
serum were examined in normal pregnant women in the first, second, and  
third trimesters, and early postpartum period, and in patients with mild
and severe preeclampsia and with essential hypertension . placentas at  
term were also examined for total lipid and its fatty acid composition .
in the normal women, total serum lipid increased during pregnancy . the 
rise was less pronounced in those with preeclampsia or hypertension .   
serum palmitate was mildly but significantly elevated in preeclampsia . 
total lipid and arachidonic acid were elevated in the placentas of      
preeclamptic women . the findings are compared with those obtained from 
animals developing eclampsia on an experimental basis .

essential fatty acids and acids with trans-configuration in the         
subcutaneous and visceral fat of the newborn .                          
  we made an investigation of the subcutaneous and visceral fat in the  
newborn . we estimated the contents of linolic and linolenic acid and of
acids with trans-configuration spectrophotometrically .                 
  we were able to show the penetration of these acids through the       
placental barrier . the essential fatty acid contents of fat in the     
newborn is low . in immature ones about 7-14 g, there is a rising trend.

acetoacetate formation by livers from human fetuses aged 8-17 weeks .   
  slices and homogenates from livers of human fetuses aged 8-17 weeks   
have a low rate of acetoacetate formation which can be raised by        
addition of acetate or octanoate to the incubation medium . it was not  
possible to demonstrate acetoacetate formation by isolated liver        
mitochondria from 17-week-old fetuses, probably because mitochondria are
injured during isolation .

changes in blood glucose and non-esterified fatty acids in the foetal

  changes in blood glucose and non-esterified fatty acids after         
intravenous adrenaline were measured in foetal, newborn and adult sheep 
in the foetus and immediately after birth there was very little       
increase in either blood glucose or non-esterified fatty acids after    
adrenaline . the response of blood glucose to adrenaline had reached    
adult levels at twenty-four hours of age . the response of non-esterifi-
ed fatty acids to adrenaline increased gradually over the first week .

electron-microscopic observatations on transference of fat through the  
human placenta .                                                        
  from the results of our previous and present studied on the           
transportation of fat through the human placenta by means of electron   
microscopy, we obtained the following conclusions .                     
  1) neutral fat can permeate through the human placenta without        
dissociation .                                                          
  2) almost all processes of fat permeation seem to be due to the       
biological activity . pinocytosis is most representative, but the       
authors newly found several facts such as dissolution-like change in the
basement membrane and transport via the stroma cell . the authors       
believe that these results will bring a clue to explain the mechanism of
biological transportation of materials through the placenta .

the content of phosphatides, triglycerides and cholesterol in placentas,
maternal, fetal and new-born liver of the white rat .                   
  thin-layer-chromatographic examinations in the maternal rat liver     
showed different rise of the triglycerides and a significant increase of
the esterified cholesterol, however, no striking changes in the content 
of free cholesterol and lipid phosphorus with the fractions examined    
(lecithin, colamine cephalin, sphingomyelin and lysolecithin) .         
  as compared to the liver of adult rats, the fetal liver contains a    
little less than 50 per cent lipid phosphorus . the difference is       
conditioned by the concentrations of lecithin, and colamine cephalin .  
on the 19th day the content of triglycerides is lower than in the mother
rat . referred to the dry weight, there results a decrease of all       
phosphatide fractions, as well as of the free cholesterol and a slight  
rise of the triglycerides from the 19th to the 22nd day .               
  the rise of the phosphatide concentrations to the values of adult rats
occurs immediately after birth under the influence of milk food, which, 
moreover, leads to a considerable increase of the triglyceride values . 
phospholipid- and triglyceride concentrations of the placenta correspond
to those of the fetal liver . solely the content of free cholesterol is 
higher at the end of pregnancy . the content of triglyceride drops      
towards the 22nd day .

analysis of mammalian lens proteins by electrophoresis .                
  lens proteins of different mammalian species were analyzed by         
two-dimensional starch gel electrophoresis . the number of fractions    
detected by this means varied from 11-20 . a-crystallin was resolved    
into two to three components, b-crystallin into 5-11, and y-crystallin  
into three to five components . this technique provides a sensitive     
method for the fractionation of lens proteins and for analyzing species 
differences .

an autoradiographic study on cell migration in the eye lens epithelium  
from normal and alloxan diabetic rats .                                 
  lenses from normal and alloxan diabetic rats with and without cataract
were investigated by autoradiography 4 hours, 4 days and 8 days after an
intraperitoneal injection of h3-thymidine (0.4 uc/g body weight) . the  
rats were made diabetic 8 days prior to the injection of thymidine at an
age of 4 weeks . the position of labelled nuclei of the lens epithelium 
was noted and their grain numbers counted . the diabetic rats had a     
lower frequency of labelled nuclei than the controls but after 4 hours  
their grain counts were equal . frequency diagrams of labelled nuclei   
are given for each of the three experimental periods . a predominant    
peak appears after 4 hours at a distance of 30-60 cells in front of the 
beginning of the nuclear arc . a successive shift towards this area was 
observed for the longer experimental periods . the shift of the peaks   
was more restricted in the diabetic animals . this result may best be   
interpreted as an effect of an increased time of cell generation .      
  as an appendix a histotechnique for the eye lens is given in          
collaboration with mrs. gertraude moewis .

lens development.. the differentiation of embryonic chick lens          
epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo .                                 
  the behavior of lens epithelial cells from six-day chick embryos was  
studied in three different experimental situations.. (a) explantation   
into several different fluid culture media, (b) explantation followed by
reimplantation into lensectomized embryonic eyes, and (c) explantation  
followed by reimplantation into the embryonic coelomic cavity .         
specimens were examined histologically, and the total volume of the lens
material of each specimen was determined from the planimetry of serial  
sections . the results were interpreted as follows..                    
  1. with a small amount of protein supplement in the culture medium,   
embryonic lens epithelial cells are capable of a limited amount of      
independent cytodifferentiation . without protein supplement they fail  
to undergo any fiber formation .                                        
  2. when returned to the eye environment, cultured epithelial explants 
will respond with a resumption of growth, with further cellular         
differentiation, and with at least some of the morphogenetic changes    
necessary to form a lens . the embryonic coelom will not support these  
responses .                                                             
  3. the initiation of the formation of lens fibers is not sufficient   
for their complete autonomous maturation .                              
  4. the internal architecture of the developing lens is not the only   
determinant of its overall shape .

treatment of active chronic hepatitis and lupoid hepatitis with         
6-mercaptopurine and azothioprine .                                     
  6-mercaptopurine or azothioprine ('imuran') was used successfully in 3
patients with active chronic hepatitis and 2 with lupoid hepatitis, for 
periods up to 1 year . these drugs allowed modification and even        
abolition of discomforting corticosteroid regimes . their action in     
chronic hepatitis may be analogous to their anti-immune action in       
suppressing homograft rejection .

was obtained in 17 patients,. and, in 20 out of 22 patients who had been
on long-term glucocorticoid medication, the steroid therapy could be    
permanently discontinued . serious complications occurred, in the form  
of two deaths from pancytopenia and sepsis . the treatment requires

  two cases of systemic lupus erythematosus along with terminal uremia  
secondary to lupus nephritis are presented . both patients were treated 
with renal hemodialysis and transplantation . certain mechanical,       
infectious, and immunologic problems were responsible for their death . 
there was no evidence of resurgence of lupus erythematosus in either    
patient, and the transplanted kidneys did not show evidence of lupus    
nephritis . renal transplantation should be considered as a last resort 
in treatment of patients with terminal lupus nephritis .

renal amyloidosis a clinicopathological study .                         
  the clinical and histopathological data from 40 cases of renal        
amyloidosis diagnosed by percutaneous renal biopsy are presented .      
  twenty-two cases were labelled as 'secondary' amyloidosis, as definite
aetiological factors responsible for renal amyloidosis could be         
discovered . the predisposing disease states leading to amyloid deposits
in the kidney in the order of frequency were fibrocaseous pulmonary     
tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, lung abscess, and ileocaecal tuberculosis 
five cases were labelled as suspected 'primary' amyloidosis as a      
definite evidence of the predisposing disease could not be obtained     
although the skiagram of chest revealed minimal healed foci . no cause  
could be determined in thirteen cases, which were, therefore, labelled  
as 'primary' amyloidosis .                                              
  albuminuria was a constant feature in all the cases and 32 cases      
presented as nephrotic syndrome . the rest of the cases presented with  
hypertension or renal failure in addition to albuminuria .              
  the ancillary procedure, viz., congo-red test, gingival and liver     
biopsies proved to be of limited value in the diagnosis of renal

  a case is reported of a sixty-nine year old woman with severe,        
idiopathic, autoimmune hemolytic anemia which was initially controlled  
by splenectomy . a relapse associated with the development of severe,   
autoimmune, thrombocytopenic purpura failed to respond to large doses of
prednisone, but was controlled to a variable degree with imuran .       
  associated features included diffuse hypergammaglobulinemia, excessive
gamma-u proteins in the urine, idiopathic hypoalbuminemia with a greatly
reduced total exchangeable albumin pool, amyloidosis in the spleen and  
other organs, and diffuse plasmacytosis of the bone marrow, lymph nodes,
and thoracic and peritoneal fat . these features and their              
interrelationships are discussed . there was no deficiency in the       
synthesis of specific neutralizing antibodies against viruses,

corticosteroid therapy of amyloid nephrotic syndrome .                  
  the results of treatment with prolonged adrenal corticosteroids in 26 
adults with amyloid nephrotic syndrome are presented . eight subjects

survival after onset of the disease of 17.6 months . the renal disease  
was indistinguishable from that seen in other forms of the nephrotic    
syndrome, with the possible exceptions of (a) a high incidence of       
purpuric skin lesions, (b) a low or negligible incidence of hypertension
(at times actual hypotension was prominent), and (c) a rapid and        
inexorable progression of azotemia despite persistence of the clinical  
and biochemical characteristics of the nephrotic syndrome . amyloidosis 
was found by percutaneous renal biopsy in 12 per cent of 83 adults with 
the nephotic syndrome .                                                 
  corticosteroids did not appear to affect the progress of the disease  
and were neither beneficial nor detrimental . in view of the high       
incidence of deleterious side effects of prolonged corticosteroid       
therapy and the availability of potent diuretic agents which may be     
helpful in relieving edema in this disorder, it is felt that            
corticosteroids are contraindicated in the treatment of amyloid         
nephrotic syndrome .

renal amyloidosis.. a biopsy study .                                    
  the relationship of the amount of amyloid deposition in the kidney to 
the clinical picture is reviewed in 14 cases of renal amyloidosis       
diagnosed by renal biopsy . the large percentage of patients who had the
nephrotic syndrome (11 patients) probably reflects the criteria for     
renal biopsy at this institution . the etiology of the amyloid          
deposition did not seem to be clearly correlated with either the amount 
of amyloid deposition in the kidney or the severity of the clinical     
renal disease . all patients had deposits in the glomerulus, and the    
heavier the deposition the severer the renal disease . of 7 patients who
had biopsy of the bone marrow, all had abnormal types or numbers of     
plasma cells . the age range in primary amyloidosis appeared to be about
the same as that in amyloidosis secondary to myeloma . amyloidosis      
should be suspected in patients with proteinuria, the nephrotic         
syndrome, or renal failure .

from amyloid .                                                          
  proteins extracted by strong urea from washed tissue of patients with 
amyloidosis secondary to several diseases or associated with familial   
mediterranean fever have common major electrophoretic components . in   
hearts of primary amyloidosis one component in common with the secondary
amyloid may be present . however, primary amyloid is much more difficult
to dissolve and does not regularly give the components observed when the
secondary amyloid is extracted . the big question remains as to what    
constituent or constituents comprise the fibrils now known to be a part

selectivity of protein excretion in patients with the nephrotic syndrome.
  with a gel diffusion precipitin technique and commercially prepared   
antisera, urine/plasma ratios of specific proteins were determined .    
individual protein clearances, expressed as a percentage of transferrin 
clearance, were plotted as ordinates against respective molecular       
weights on a log-log graph . a straight line was evident graphically,   
its constants were estimated by the method of least squares, and the    
slope, expressed as , was determined . the slope of the line may be said
to express the degree of glomerular selectivity to protein excretion .  
sixty-five determinations were performed in 48 patients . 45 satisfying 
the usual criteria of the nephrotic syndrome .                          
  1) those patients with primary renal disease and the nephrotic        
syndrome who displayed high selectivity types of proteinuria ( greater  
than the average for the group + 1 sd) usually respond initially to     
steroid therapy, regardless of the acute or subacute glomerular changes 
observed on renal biopsy .                                              
  2) those patients with chronic renal disease and the nephrotic        
syndrome display an average and frequently a low selectivity type of    
proteinuria .                                                           
  3) there appears to be no characteristic type of selectivity for a    
given pathologic group of patients with the nephrotic syndrome .        
  4) the degree of selective protein excretion is not related to the    
total daily amount of protein being excreted at any one time and remains
fairly constant despite fluctuation in the amount of protein being      
excreted .                                                              
  5) there is a slight correlation of borderline significance between   
the degree of selective protein excretion and the duration of the       
disease, and the initial para-aminohippuric acid clearance .            
  6) a statistically significant correlation exists between the initial 
blood urea nitrogen or inulin clearance and the selectivity type of     
protein excretion . those patients who were not azotemic and had        
initially near-normal inulin clearances had an average selectivity type 
or better .                                                             
  7) it is suggested that if the adult patient is initially azotemic and
has a grossly abnormal inulin clearance, response to therapy is         
unlikely, whereas if the blood urea nitrogen is normal and the inulin   
clearance is near normal, response to therapy cannot be predicted with  
any degree of accuracy . further studies of adult patients with the     
nephrotic syndrome are required to substantiate this premise .

excretion patterns of urinary metabolites of estradiol-4-c14 in         
postmenopausal women with benign and malignant disease of the breast .  
  a study of the excretion patterns of the urinary metabolites of       
estradiol-4-c1j administered to a group of 43 postmenopausal women, 38  
with advanced mammary carcinoma prior to endocrine therapy and 5 with   
benign mammary dysplasia, is reported . a chromatographic method was    
employed for the determination of estradiol, estrone, and estriol and   
other estrogen metabolites . the urinary excretion pattern is defined by
(a) the extent of excretion of isotope in each of 3 successive 24-hr.   
collection periods, (b) the percentage of the urinary radiometabolites  
enzymatically hydrolyzed, (c) the relative concentration of the several 
metabolites in the hydrolyzed fraction . wide subject-to-subject        
variations were found . the metabolites other than estradiol, estrone,  
and estriol comprised a large portion of the total estrogens excreted . 
a significantly lower amount of estradiol was noted in the group of     
women with mammary carcinoma as compared to the amount found in the     
group of women with benign mammary dysplasia, suggesting that the former
group metabolizes more rapidly the administered estradiol . although the
excretion patterns of patients who failed to respond to estrogen        
treatment (nonresponders) differed the greatest from the patterns       
associated with benign disease, distinctive patterns of the urinary     
excretion of isotopic estrogens which allowed a statistically           
significant or clinically useful separation between responders and      
nonresponders to subsequent estrogen therapy were not discovered .

the development of social attachments in infancy .                      
  this report is devoted to the formation and development of social     
attachments in infancy . it is suggested that the core of the attachment
function is represented by the tendency of the young to seek the        
proximity of certain other members of the species and that the most     
suitable operational definition may be found in the behavior of the     
individual when deprived of such proximity .                            
  the study takes the form of a longitudinal follow-up, in which 60     
infants were investigated at four-weekly intervals from the early weeks 
on up to the end of the first year and again at 18 months of age . with 
the use of an attachment scale, based on seven everyday separation      
situations, the following three main parameters were explored.. the age 
at onset of specific attachments, the intensity of such attachments, and
the number of objects to whom attachments are formed . a measure of     
fear-of-strangers was also included .                                   
  results indicate that the age at onset of specific attachments is     
generally to be found in the third quarter of the first year, but that  
this is preceded by a phase of indiscriminate attachment behavior,. that
the intensity of specific attachment increases most in the first month  
following onset and that thereafter fluctuations occur in individual    
cases which make long-term prediction difficult,. and that multiplicity 
of objects can be found in some instances at the very beginning of the  
specific attachment phase, becoming the rule in most of the remaining   
cases very soon thereafter . correlations between the attachment        
variables, as well as with the fear-of-strangers measure, are presented,
and an examination is also made of the conditions eliciting protest at  
proximity loss, of the manner in which protest is expressed, and of the 
conditions necessary to terminate protest .                             
  individual differences with regard to the three main parameters were  
explored in a subgroup of 36 infants . a number of variables were       
examined in relation to these individual differences, and suggestions   
made regarding the conditions which affect the manifestation of the     
attachment function .                                                   
  the data are discussed in relation to four themes which emerged from  
the findings.. the nature of the attachment function, its developmental 
origins, its developmental trends, and the influence of the social      
setting .

separation anxiety as a cause of early emotional problems in children . 
  in summary, three cases of disturbed behavior in children have been   
discussed, with particular emphasis on disturbances in feeding,         
sleeping, and motility . some of the hypotheses have been presented of  
why such behavior should develop,. the significance of attachment       
behavior and separation anxiety in infants has been particularly        
stressed . difficulties in mothering care are threatening to the child's
sense of security and lead to greater experience of separation anxiety, 
which may then be reflected in various disturbances or alterations in   
his behavior . this experience of separation anxiety is the result of   
early life experience, may reach pathologic proportions, and may account
for many later problems in children and adults .

  chromatographic fractionations have been performed on the             
ultracentrifugal supernatants of homogenates of rat lung and liver by   
the use of columns of dextran gel (sephadex g-100) . a major proportion 
of nickel in these tissue supernatants has been demonstrated to be      
firmly bound to macromolecular constituents . following acute and       
chronic inhalation of carcinogenic levels of nickel carbonyl, the       
predominant increases in the concentrations of nickel have been observed
in the macromolecular fractions . these findings are consistent with the
previous demonstration of nickel in purified preparations of ribonucleic
acids (rna) from several rat tissues, and with the observation of       
increased concentrations of nickel in high-molecular weight rna from    
lung and liver following the inhalation of nickel carbonyl .

  1. ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid reversibly inhibits the

intradermal test using cobalt chloride .                                
  selected groups of patients with cobalt allergy and nickel allergy as 
well as normal controls were tested intradermally with cobalt chloride  
in the dilutions 10 to 10 . reactions of the wheal and flare type appear
during the first hours and make the 24-hour reading misleading . the    
papular response to cobalt chloride 10, when read 48 to 96 hours after  
the injection, appears to be a reliable test for cobalt allergy .       
patients with combined nickel-cobalt allergy were excluded from the     
study, and the question of group reactions is not discussed . nickel    
allergics give a somewhat stronger reaction than controls to the        
slightly impure cobalt chloride . it would be preferable if the degree  
of purity of the cobalt chloride were ten times greater .

measurements of nickel in biological materials by atomic absorption

  an atomic absorption procedure has been developed which facilitates   
quantitative measurements of nickel in biological materials, including  
urine, ribonucleic acids (rna), and serum proteins .                    
  the sensitivity of detection of nickel by the atomic absorption       
spectrometer (0.10 p.p.m.) was insufficient to permit direct            
measurements of nickel in normal urine . therefore, it was necessary to 
employ a dimethylglyoxime extraction procedure to concentrate the       
nickel, prior to atomic absorption spectrometry .                       
  the coefficients of variation of measurements of nickel in urine and  
human b- globulins were 6.3 and 5.9 per cent, respectively . the        
recovery of nickel added to urine averaged 96 per cent, with a range    
from 94 to 97, and the recovery of nickel added to human b-globulin     
averaged 101 per cent, with a range from 96 to 104 .                    
  the mean concentration of nickel in 24-hr. collections of urine from  
17 normal subjects was 1.8 ug. per 100 ml. (s.d. = 0.8), with a range   
from 0.4 to 3.1 . the mean urinary excretion of nickel was 19.8 ug. per 
24 hr. (s.d. = 10.0), with a range from 7.2 to 37.6 .                   
  the mean concentration of nickel in 5 preparations of ribonucleic     
acids from ultracentrifugal supernatants of homogenates of rat lung was 
48 ug. of ni per gm. of rna, with a range from 34 to 64 . the mean      
concentration of nickel in 5 preparations of rna from ultracentrifugal  
supernatants of homogenates of rat liver was 29 ug. of ni per gm. of    
rna, with a range from 21 to 39 .                                       
  measurements of nickel were performed upon fractions of human serum   
proteins, prepared by continuous-flow electrophoresis, and by

  the time course and extent of the methemoglobinemia induced by        
intraperitoneal sodium nitrite and p-aminopropiophenone (papp) have been
characterized in female mice . the peak methemoglobin formation (34 ) is
achieved in about 40 minutes . comparable levels from papp (15 mg/kg)   
are achieved more quickly (between 5 and 10 minutes) but decline more   
rapidly to normal . both nitrite- and papp-induced methemoglobinemia    
afford a significant degree of protection against poisoning by sodium   
azide when administered in an appropriate time sequence . it was not    
possible under the same circumstances to protect mice against death from
fluoride, cyanate, thiocyanate, selenate, or borate, although some      
prolongation of survival time was seen after fluoride . the formation of
the azide-methemoglobin complex has been demonstrated within intact     
mouse red blood cells, and small amounts of the complex were identified 
in vivo in an antidotal situation . we think it important that the      
protective action of methemoglobinemia has been demonstrated to date    
only against established inhibitors of cytochrome oxidase .

highest level of sulfur-35 (1600 uc) injected into eggs containing 4-day
embryos produced morphological abnormalities more severe than those     
produced by the same level of radiosulfur administered to 8-day embryos,
or by any level of stable selenium tolerated . selenium at levels       
greater than 30 ug killed all the embryos within 24 hours after         
injection . nearly 20 times more tellurium than selenium was required to
kill all the embryos within 24 hours.. no abnormalities were observed in
the tellurium-injected embryos .

the effect of selenium on the upper respiratory passages .              
  results are reported of examination of workers exposed to selenium,   
with special reference to chronic changes in the respiratory passages . 
the findings are the same as reported in the literature . we emphasize  
the occurrence of teleangiectasias on the uvula and on the posterior    
palatinal arcs and on the epiglotis . we describe the occurrence of the 
first poisoning with selenium xyde in this country . the poisoning      
healed within a few days under symptomatic treatment . the patient had  
however to be transferred into another shop owing to frequent symptoms  
due to toxic effect of selenium . we report also on secondary findings  
in examination of chronic changes and we emphasize particularly the     
finding of profesional selenium external otitis .

the influence of small selenite doses upon the toxic fatty degeneration 
of the liver .                                                          
  sodium selenite (10 ug/kg) manifests a lipotropic effect after        
toxication of the rat by tetrachlorocarbon . this effect is absent when 
the selenite dose is increased to 50 ug/kg . the level of the total     
lipides of the liver after ethionine toxication is not significantly    
influenced by 10 ug selenite/kg . it is increased by 50 ug selenite/kg.

selenium-caused tumours .                                               
  in 10 out of 23 heterozygous rats administered 10 mg na seo per 1 kg  
food (containing 12 protein) and surviving for 18 months, cancer of the 
liver (with metastases in the lungs) along with sarcoma and adenoma was 
recorded . in another series of the yet incompleted experiment the      
animals were fed higher quantities of protein and selenium . toward     
14-19 months in three of them sarcoma was noted.. in two sarcoma of the 
lymphatic nodes, and in one- of the mediastinum .                       
  it is suggested that the changes caused by selenium compounds are to  
some extent due to their antagonistic relationship with methionine .

ehrlich ascites tumor cells agglutination.. the interference exerted by 
epsilonaminocaproic acid (eac) and its acetyl derivative (eaca) .       
  the activity of epsilon-aminocaproic acid (eac) and of its acetyl     
derivative (eaca) was studied on antigen-antibody reactions, membrane   
antigens and immune globulins .                                         
  in vitro eac and eaca do not affect immune globulins, but they do     
alter the membrane antigens of ehrlich ascites tumor cells and inhibit  
the agglutination reaction induced by a specific antiserum . inhibition 
is only partially due to the antigenic alteration observed, and it      
represents more prominently a direct interference at the level of the   
antigen-antibody reaction .                                             
  the membrane antigen alternations induced by the drugs and by nitrogen
mustard were compared, taking into account their toxicity.. eac and eaca

current status of hypothermia .                                         
  moderate hypothermia has been recommended for many and varied         
conditions . today its value is being questioned in the light of        
controlled groups of patients . at the moment its use is justified in   
certain cardiac and other operations where circulation may be           
interrupted for short periods.. in general surgical procedures where    
massive, sudden blood loss may be anticipated.. in neurosurgical        
operations where a /relaxed/ brain is required.. following acute hypoxia
such as seen in cardiac arrest.. and perhaps in the therapy of acute    
septicemic shock .                                                      
  profound hypothermia in association with extracorporeal circulation   
rests on shakier premises, but can be of value in major cardiac         
operations where asystole is required and in certain neurosurgical      
procedures where complete interruption of circulation is indicated .    
  there is a great hazard in the development of inadvertent or          
unrecognized hypothermia in the anesthetized patient . monitoring of    
body temperature is an important feature of the care of the patient in  
the operating theater and in the recovery room .

hyperglycemic coronary perfusion.. effect of hypothermia on myocardial  
function during cardiopulmonary bypass .                                
  in a series of 84 animal experiments hyperglycemic perfusion of the   
heart gave significant protection to the anoxic heart . this protection 
was evaluated by ventricular function and contractile force studies and 
was observed after aortic occlusion at 37, 28 and 10 degrees c .        
  metabolic data revealed a considerable myocardial glucose uptake,     
higher coronary ph, higher po and lower pco in the glucose-perfused     
groups as compared to controls .                                        
  a hypothesis for the protective effect may be an alteration in        
metabolic pathway and support of the myocardial enzyme systems          
associated with high glucose concentration and utilization .

specific carcinoembryonic antigens of the human digestive system .      
  a wide variety of human adult and fetal tissues were studied by       
immunodiffusion techniques in agar gel to determine whether they        
contained the tumor-specific antigen(s) previously found in colonic     
cancers . in the adult tissues it was demonstrated that identical       
antigens were present in all tested specimens of malignant tumors of the
entodermally derived epithelium of the gastro-intestinal tract and      
pancreas, but were absent from all other tested adult tissues . the     
common antigenic constituents, therefore, represent system-specific     
cancer antigens of the human digestive system . system-specific cancer  
antigens have not previously been demonstrated in humans .              
  experiments with fetal tissues demonstrated that identical antigens   
were also present in fetal gut, liver, and pancreas between 2 and 6     
months of gestation . these components were named /carcinoembryonic/    
antigens of the human digestive system . on the basis of the present    
findings and the recent work regarding control of the expression of     
genetic potentialities in various genetic potentialities in various     
types of cells, it was concluded that the carcinoembryonic antigens     
represent cellular constituents which are repressed during the course of
differentiation of the normal digestive system epithelium and reappear  
in the corresponding malignant cells by a process of                    
derepressive-dedifferentiation .

shown in the lungs and liver of mice infected with the pr 8 strain . the

comparative bone marrow study using two aspiration needles and two      
biopsy sites .                                                          
  bone marrow aspiration is now widely used in the diagnosis of         
hematologic diseases and many conditions not primarily affecting the    
blood system . a number of techniques have been devised by which a      
suitable specimen of marrow can be obtained with relatively little      
discomfort to the patient . the two needle sets described in this paper 
have been found to be equally reliable in obtaining bone marrow for     
microscopic study and diagnosis . comparative studies of bone marrow    
aspirated simultaneously from the iliac crest and the sternum in 26     
patients show no significant difference . however, there were four      
instances of dry tap at the iliac site . this fact, in addition to the  
observation that less discomfort was experienced by the patient when the
sternum was used, might indicate that the sternal area is a more        
reliable and efficient site for obtaining bone marrow .                 
  it was also observed during this study that patients experienced less 
discomfort when the university of illinois needle was used . the major  
objection to the use of this needle is the inability to obtain a bone   
core for biopsy .

  the depressing effect of dehydroepiandrosterone on plasma             
corticosteroids is, on an average, shortened in advanced breast cancer  
(stage iv) . the lowest corticosteroid values have been found with the  
three groups of patients 6 hours after infusion of                      
dehydroepiandrosterone phosphate . the effect of dehydroepiandrosterone 
being, still provable after 12 hours with the group suffering from      
mastopathy, the breast cancer group of stage iv had at this time already
reached the level of the initial values . the breast cancer group of    
stage iv had at this time already reached the level of the initial      
values . the breast cancer group of stage i/ii behaved intermediately . 
the less lasting effect of dehydroepiandrosterone is attributed to its  
accelerated transformation in advanced breast cancer .

the meaning of ph at low temperatures during extra-corporeal circulation
  a review of the temperature gradients occurring during profound       
hypothermia is made in regard to acid base changes in general, and to ph
readings in particular . it is concluded that terms such as 'body',     
'mean', 'average' and 'core' temperature should be discarded and that   
when a temperature is quoted it should be referred to the site at which 
it was measured .                                                       
  the main circumstances in which blood ph is measured at a temperature 
different from that at which the blood is equilibrated with respiratory 
gases are reviewed by describing the changes which occur during         
tonometry experiments . in this way fundamental changes can be          
understood before considering the more complicated sequences of events  
taking place in the living body .                                       
  the alterations that occur in the concentrations of protein and       
bicarbonate ion when whole blood is cooled are reviewed, together with  
their influence on 'correction factors' . the reasons why these factors 
should not be applied to blood when the living body is undergoing       
hypothermia involving the use of an extra-corporeal circulation are     
discussed .                                                             
  examples of the numerical values for blood ph during the two main     
methods for producing profound hypothermia, one using autogenous lung   
perfusion and the other a pump-oxygenator are given, with reference to  
the influence of pco2 upon these values .                               
  the existing methods of acid-base measurement appear to be            
sufficiently accurate to reflect the metabolic component during profound
hypothermia .

  the human sarcoma hs has been grown in weanling rats treated with     
cortisone . this growth was modified by prior injection of various      
tissue antigens . active /immunity/ was produced by using human placenta
or embryonic tissue as antigen, and similar results were obtained using 
suspensions of rapidly growing human tumours .                          
  the response to other human tissues varied.. foetal muscle and spleen 
were active, whereas adult plasma was inactive except from some patients
with extensive malignant disease .                                      
  passive protection was produced by using certain human sera at the    
time of challenging with hs . sera from five women who aborted showed   
this characteristic . where the pregnancy continued to term,            
antisubstances were not found,. and they were present in the puerperium 
in only two out of fifty cases .                                        
  further groups of rats were given rat embryonic tissues as antigen,   
and the tumour challenge was then made with walker tumour,. the results 
were variable .                                                         
  with a benzpyrene-induced tumour in a pure line of /wag/ rat the      
effect was not obtained except in isolated cases .                      
  in experiments in mice, using as challenge an irondextran induced     
mouse sarcoma, prior injection with embryonic mouse liver or placenta   
increased the resistance to the growth of the tumour, but the tumour has
not as yet been produced in a pure-line mouse . on the other hand mouse 
experiments, using as challenge the crocker tumour, proved negative .   
  it is suggested that immune reactions may play a part in causing some 
abortions .

  a clinical trial has been carried out to test the use of the          
discriminant in assessing the suitability of patients with advanced     
breast cancer for hypophysectomy or adrenalectomy .

  it has been shown that glucosamine-1- c administered intravenously to 
fed rats is rapidly removed from the blood stream and appears first as  
trichloroacetic acid-soluble derivatives in the tissues . this is       
followed by a conversion to macromolecules . at least 80 of the         
administered compound can be recovered in tissues . the liver is by far 
the most active organ in accumulating glucosamine . this is rapidly     
converted to protein-bound components of the liver particulate fraction 
(microsomes and mitochondria) and is then released to the plasma without
appreciable accumulation in the soluble proteins of the liver . it is   
concluded that the glucosamine is transferred to the peptide chains of  
glycoproteins at some stage before these proteins are released from the

  1. light microscopic observations on the development of the rat lung

  2. these same three stages can be identified by electron microscopy   
and all may be present in different parts of the lung at one time, e.g. 
at 40 and 45 mm. c.r. length .                                          
  3. in the glandular stage, the lung tissue itself has an immature     
appearance by light microscopy and by electron microscopy individual    
cells also are immature in respect of organelles . glycogen is present  
in immature cells .

  5. throughout all stages of development, the 'duct' or 'air' spaces   
are always lined by a continuous and complete epithelium, and blood     
vessels by a complete endothelium .

  7. micropinocytotic vesicles are present in large numbers in both

electron microscopy . mice were inoculated with 1.5 ld of pr8 influenza 
virus and killed at varying intervals after inoculation . observations  
by light microscopy were correlated with those by electron microscopy in
order to evaluate the lesions produced .                                
  at the periphery, the earliest lesions were focal areas of edema of   
alveolar lining cells, the capillary endothelium and the interposed     
basement membrane . this caused an appreciable thickening of the        
blood-air pathway . hypertrophy, degeneration and desquamation of the   
alveolar lining and proliferation of alveolar macrophages resulted in   
complete consolidation, which was progressive up to 1 week after        
infection .                                                             
  the central areas of the lung were affected somewhat differently . at 
3 days after infection, the nonciliated bronchiolar cells showed        
considerable hyperplasia of endoplasmic reticulum and apical cytoplasmic
edema . viral particles matured at the lumen surface of these cells and 
were then released into the bronchiolar lumen . the bronchiolar cells,  
both ciliated and nonciliated, underwent degeneration and sloughed into 
the bronchiolar lumen . the regenerating epithelium was stratified, and 
the surface cells were elongated and flattened . the peribronchiolar    
interstitial tissue gradually became totally infiltrated by cells,      
mostly of the mononuclear type .

studies on aging with horse crystalline lens gel as a contribution to   
biomorphosis of the mammalian crystalline lens .                        
  the effects of biomorphosis -dash the continuous material change in   
the chemical composition of the organs and tissues -dash are studied on 
the horse crystalline lens in respect of its amino acid content subject 
to substantial variations in the course of life . it is shown by        
electrophoretic and paperchromatographic methods that the qualitative   
composition of horse crystalline lenses remains quite the same, but that
within the individual age stages there occur quantitative variations    
between the individual amino acids .

the role of alveolar inclusion bodies in the developing lung .          
  the developing alveolar epithelium of man and rat contains            
characteristic inclusion bodies which are heterogeneous structures but  
basically consist of a system of membranous profiles and a limiting     
membrane of the unit type .                                             
  inclusion bodies appear to result from focal cytoplasmic degradation  
which occurs in the rapidly changing cuboidal alveolar epithelium . some
inclusion bodies in the developing rat lung are similar to the so-called
/lamellar transformed mitochondria./ however, evidence is presented     
suggesting that alteration of all cytoplasmic membranes may be involved 
in the process of inclusion body formation . certain images associated  
with the golgi complex are interpreted as early forms of inclusion      
bodies . there is also evidence that inclusion bodies enlarge by        
accretion of membranes which finally are extruded into the alveolar     
space . inclusion bodies are formed and /secreted/ in greater number    
late in fetal life and in early infancy, i.e., at the time when the     
cuboidal alveolar epithelium is differentiating to the mature flattened 
type . the latter contains no inclusion bodies .                        
  on the basis of the morphologic characteristics of the inclusion      
bodies and the distribution of the acid phosphatase reaction, it is     
concluded that inclusion bodies are lysosomal structures active during  
remodeling of the developing alveolar epithelium .                      
  the possible interrelationship of inclusion bodies and pulmonary      
surfactant is discussed .

postural changes in blood distribution and its relation to the change in
cardiac output .                                                        
  (1) cardiac output and the blood content indices of the several parts 
of the body were measured in 18 subjects including patients with various
diseases using external radioisotope counting techniques . changes in   
these 2 parameters induced by standing were compared with each other .  
  (2) average changes in blood distribution produced by standing were as
follows . decrease in blood content in the /lung/ (-25 ) and in the     
/heart/ (-26 ) and increase in the /thigh/ (+56 ) were statistically    
significant . no significant change was revealed in the /head/, /palm/, 
/liver/ and /abdomen/ .                                                 
  (3) cardiac output and stroke volume decreased by standing in most of 
the cases . recent data were added to those reported previously and were
treated statistically . average decrease in cardiac output was -13 in 6 
control cases, -35 in 16 cases with neurocirculatory asthenia and -35 in
10 cases with hyperthyroidism . the difference was significant between  
control and neurocirculatory asthenia . standing induced a substantial  
increase in cardiac output in a case of idiopathic nodal rhythm,        
although there remains a doubt whether it is the ordinary response in   
this disease .                                                          
  (4) significant linear correlation was revealed between per cent      
change of blood content in the /thigh/ or in the /lung/ and that of     
cardiac output or stroke volume induced by standing . minimal blood     
shift was observed when the latter was extreme, and vice versa . this   
implies as follows.. reactivity of the heart might be influenced by     
posture, and transmural pressure of veins and or capillaries is probably
adjusted, as in arterioles, to compensate for changes in cardiac output

comparative studies of the glycogen content of heart, liver and brain   
before and after iodine treatment and under conditions of asphyxia .    
  blood sugar level and glycogen concentration in the heart, brain and  
liver of rabbits after treatment with inorganic iodine, depot insulin,  
iodine and insulin combined, hostacortine and hostacortine and iodine   
combined are being examined . a control group remains untreated . in a  
second test series the glycogen determination under asphyxia (the       
trachea is being pinched off for three minutes) is repeated .           
  contrary to the brain the glycogen content of the heart muscle is not 
dependent upon the blood sugar level . after iodine treatment a lowering
of the blood sugar becomes noticeable, but also an increase in heart    
glycogen . the liver glycogen shows greater variations . the levels     
achieved in these test series therefore show no significant differences 
during asphyxia there is a significant lowering of glycogen in all    
three organs . preliminary treatment with iodine succeeds in stopping   
the lowering of glycogen in the heart muscle and the brain . the        
possible causes for this phenomenon are being discussed .

altered immunologic activity in sarcoidosis .                           
  studies in 16 patients with sarcoidosis revealed evidence of          
immunologic alterations other than impaired delayed hypersensitivity .  
transient impairment of the response of lymphocytes cultured from       
patients with sarcoidosis to phytohemagglutinin stimulation was found to
parallel the clinical severity of the disease . the hemolytic activity  
of serum complement was increased . a disproportionate increase in serum
iga was found characteristic of the hyperglobulinemia of sarcoidosis .  
these observations indicate that an altered immune response may be      
important in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis . a simple hypothesis as to
the specific kind of interaction of infectious agent and immunity which 
might result in the immunologic alterations observed is formulated and  
presented .

electron microscopy of cytoplasmic inclusions within /macrophages/ of   
human tissue .                                                          
  the fine structure of inclusions found within the cytoplasm of        
macrophages of human lung, spleen, skin, lymph node, and rectum has been
described .                                                             
  the inclusions appear as concentric or whorled lamellae arranged      
around a core . each lamella is constructed of discrete, parallel       
filaments . the inclusions do not resemble currently described viruses  
or virus-like particles, nor do they resemble asbestos bodies or other  
known atmospheric pollutants or ingestants .                            
  there is some resemblance to lipid phase systems as well as mast cell 
granules,. possibly the inclusions represent partial intracellular      
digestion of phagocytized tissue membranes or ingested mast cell        
granules, respectively . differences and similarities exist between the 
inclusion bodies of macrophages and the granules of mast cells . such   
variations could be due to alterations in mast cell granule morphology  
before or after macrophage ingestion .                                  
  cytologic distinctions between macrophages laden with mast cell       
granules and mast cells proper, remains obscure and requires additional 
experimental evidence for clear electron microscopic differentiation of 
these two cell types .

histological research on the lens in condition of hypoxia, changes in

epithelium was studied in 24 rats of the same strain and weight . the   
hypoxia was obtained in the decompression chamber .                     
  the results show that the mitotic activity of the lens epithelium is  
depressed at any of the examined altitudes (6.500, 8.000, 9.500 m),. in 
particular, a marked reduction in the number of the prophases and an    
accumulation in metaphase was observed .                                
  the results were examined from the statistical standpoint and

rate of change of carbon dioxide tension in arterial blood, jugular

administration .                                                        
  1. the rate of change of p in arterial blood and cisternal c.s.f., was
measured following 5 percent co administration in eight anaesthetized   
patients undergoing routine air encephalography . ventilation was       
maintained constant throughout the procedure by a respirator . in three 
of the experiments the rate of change of p in the jugular venous blood  
was also measured .                                                     
  2. the rise in p varied between 25.7 and 14.8 mm hg . the final       
samples of blood and c.s.f. were taken 20-25 min after the start of co  
administration in five experiments . at this time the mean rise in p was
65.9 (maximum range 68.1-61.6 percent) of the rise in p . in the        
remaining three experiments the final samples were taken at 15 min when 
the rises in p were 53.2, 39.4 and 38.1 percent of the arterial change .
  3. the increases in p were 57.5, 76.2 and 76.1 percent of those in the
arterial blood . the changes in p in the c.s.f. were smaller than in the
jugular venous blood in all three experiments . in two of the           
experiments the final samples were taken 15 min after the start of co   
administration when the increases of p in the c.s.f. were 68.5 percent  
and 50 percent of those in jugular venous blood . in one experiment     
where the final samples were taken at 20 min the increase in p was 89   
percent of the rise in p .                                              
  4. there was a delay, following the start of co administration, in the
rise of p in jugular venous blood and in the c.s.f . this delay was     
about 1 min in the jugular venous blood but in the c.s.f. it varied from
1.6 to 4.2 min (mean 2.3) .                                             
  5. the rise of p in blood and c.s.f. was exponential . the rise in p  
in all experiments consisted of a fast component with time constants    
which varied between 0.2 and 0.9 min (mean 0.5) and a slow component    
with time constants varying between 6.7 and 14.7 (mean 11.6) .          
  the rise in p and p consisted of only one component . the time        
constants for the changes in jugular venous blood were 2.1, 3.8 and 4.3 
min, whilst in the c.s.f. they varied between 6.7 and 14.7 (mean 11.6) .
  6. it is probable that about 40 percent of the increase in ventilation
following co administration is due to stimulation of an area in the     
antero-lateral surface of the medulla sensitive to changes in ph or p   
(mitchell et al. 1963) . this area is superficial and ventilation is    
affected by changes in the p of the overlying c.s.f . it can be         
predicted from our experiments that the rise in p on co administration  
will take some 30 min to be complete . this may explain the slow rise in
ventilation on co breathing when compared with the rate of rise of      
arterial and jugular venous p .

studies on the compound lipids from x-ray irradiated animal, ii.        
biological and biochemical properties of the compound lipids in the     
x-ray irradiated rabbit organs .                                        
  for the purpose to clarify the causes of x-ray disturbances a series  
of experiments have been conducted on biological and biochemical        
properties of compound lipids extracted from normal and x-ray irradiated
rabbit organs with a special reference to the p -labeled compound lipids
uptake, inhibitory action to l cell proliferation and uncoupling of     
oxidative phosphorylation, and the following results have been obtained 
  the compound lipids (lysophosphatide rich fraction) isolated from the 
x-ray irradiated rabbit organ have been found to possess a strong       
hemolytic action and also an action to inhibit the cell proliferation as
well as to accelerate the respiration of the mitochondria in the rabbit 
liver and spleen . it has also been proven that they act as to induce a 
marked swelling of mitochondria, to impede the formation of high energy 
phosphate as well as to act as an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation
in vivo . in the test to see the uptake of p -labeled compound lipids by
various organs, a marked uptake has been observed in spleen, bone       
marrow, and liver of both irradiated and non-irradiated groups .        
further, the uptake of p -labeled compound lipids in the rabbits given  
intravenous injections of compound lipid fraction for 30 consecutive    
days previously has been found to be greatest in pancreas followed by   
bone marrow, spleen, liver in the order mentioned in male group, whereas
it is greatest in spleen, followed by liver and bone marrow in the      
female group .

cesium-131 uptake and distribution in the human heart.. an analysis of  
cardiac scans in 104 patients .                                         
  when properly used, cesium-131 is a satisfactory agent for the study  
of cardiac morphology by photoscanning, which we believe is a useful    
adjunctive diagnostic procedure in patients for whom the results of     
other methods of evaluation are at variance with the clinical symptoms  
of cardiac disease . the studies reported here suggest that perhaps     
infarction of a subclinical type, size, or location may occur earlier   
than has been previously thought and that the damage it leaves may not  
be detectable by any means other than autopsy or a technique such as    
scanning . we have not yet been able to measure the actual concentration
of cesium-131 in the heart at autopsy so that the cold and cool areas

oxygen consumption of paralysed men exposed to cold .                   
  1. oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide output were measured when    
human subjects were cooled for 80-210 min . two subjects were normal,   
one had been almost completely paralysed below the neck by              
poliomyelitis, and two were unconscious as a result of intracranial     
damage and were observed with and without paralysing doses of muscle    
relaxants (d-tubocurarine and gallamine) .                              
  2. when normal subjects and unconscious subjects receiving no drugs   
were cooled, oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide output rose .        
  3. when subjects paralysed by disease or drugs were cooled, oxygen    
consumption and carbon dioxide output were not increased .              
  4. these observations are consistent with the view that in man the    
increase in metabolism on cooling for periods up to 31/2 hr occurs      
solely in skeletal muscle .

heparin levels during and after hypothermic perfusion .

re-heparinization .                                                     
  2. heparin half-lives of approximately 13/4 hours and 21/2 hours were 
calculated during perfusions conducted at average temperatures of 31.5  
and 22.6 c. respectively .                                              
  3. the rate of heparin-loss during extracorporeal circulation is      
inconstant in an individual, and variable between individuals, so that  
exact neutralization requires an accurate estimation of the heparin     
concentration present at the end of perfusion .                         
  4. the protamine titration test provides a crude but simple and       
satisfactory means of monitoring free-heparin levels .                  
  5. complete neutralization of heparin is an important factor in       
minimizing postoperative blood losses .                                 
  6. protamine is a less efficient neutralizing agent than polybrene at 
the same dosage level . it may be most effective in divided dosage .

one instance was it of a degree likely to be significant .

platelet sequestration in man . i. methods .                            
  current methods of labeling platelets with chromium using             
ethylenediamine tetraacetate (edta) as an anticoagulant were found to   
cause rapid hepatic sequestration of nearly all the transfused platelets
about 50 returned to the circulation but then were partially destroyed
in the spleen . less than one-third survived . evidence is presented    
which indicates that edta is injurious to platelets .                   
  when an acid-citrate medium that buffered plasma at ph 6.5 was used as
an anticoagulant, 36 to 85 of the labeled platelets survived (average,  
62 ), and marked temporary sequestration did not occur . studies in     
thrombocytopenic persons showed that circulating platelet cr activity   
measures the true survival of such transfused platelets .               
  the survival and sequestration of platelets were studied in normal    
subjects . the survival data support the concept that platelets die     
chiefly by a process of senescence . external scintillation scanning of 
the various organs suggests that normally the majority of platelets is  
destroyed in the liver .

  a further case history has been presented . of the 15 patients with   
acute leukaemia in which the association has been recorded, there were  
other possible leukaemogenic factors in three, and in a further three   
the drug had been given for only a short time before the leukaemia was  
diagnosed . however, in the remaining nine, the histories are such that 
the phenylbutazone ingestion may have been associated with the          
development of the leukaemia . further studies, which should include    
matched controls, are indicated, and will be required before a definite 
opinion can be given as to any causal relationship between the drug and

excellent material for cardiac scanning, since a very low amount of

absorption of radiation can be reduced further by the administration of

hypothermia .                                                           
  the stress reaction caused by hypothermia was studied in rabbits      
subjected to controlled hypothermia by immersion in an icebath . some of
the animals were re-warmed . to anesthetize the animals, pentobarbitone 
sodium (nembutal) was given intraperitoneally, and, in some cases,      
followed by ether anesthesia . further, the stress reaction produced by 
pentobarbitone alone was studied in five animals, and that of ether     
anesthesia alone in three . no anesthesia was given to the three rabbits
placed in the refrigerator . the variation in distribution and amount of
adrenocortical lipids served as an indicator for evaluation of the      
stress reaction .                                                       
  in all the hypothermia tests there occurred changes in the            
distribution and amount of cortical lipids, denoting a stress reaction  
brought about by hypothermia . in rabbits, the barbiturate did not seem 
to inhibit the stress reaction . this may be attributed partly to the   
test animal, as such and partly to the fact that shivering of some      
extent always occurred during the hypothermia experiments .

use of a cross-circulation technique in studying respiratory responses  
to co .                                                                 
  the effect of hypercapnia and hypocapnia on ventilation was           
investigated in cross-circulated dogs in which the recipient dog's head 
and neck regions were perfused by blood from a donor dog . hypercapnia  
of the donor dog was produced by administering co -o -n gas mixtures in 
the inspired air . hypocapnia was produced by hyperventilating the donor
dog with the aid of a respiratory pump . when the donor dog was         
hyperventilated, the ventilation of the recipient was maintained at or  
just below its resting level and it was independent of the arterial pco 
of the donor . the donor dog was apneic when the artificial             
hyperventilation was suspended and this response was not abolished by   
vagotomy . bilateral vagotomy caused an increase in ventilation in the  
recipient when its head was perfused by hypocapnic blood . bilateral    
removal of the carotid receptors did not influence the response to co   
qualitatively although there was some reduction in the ventilation of   
the recipient to cephalic hypercapnia . the ventilation of the recipient
dog was best correlated to the ph and pco of its cerebrospinal fluid in 
both hypercapnic and hypocapnic states .

action of phytohaemagglutinin in vitro on the lymphocytes of chronic    
lymphoid leukaemia .                                                    
  the in vitro action of phytohaemagglutinin has been the subjects of a 
comparative investigation of the lymphocytes of 13 normal subjects and  
of 15 cases of chronic lymphatic leukaemia .                            
  in both groups there is cellular change shown by the appearance of    
large basophil nucleolated cells showing mitotic activity .             
  in all the cases of lymphatic leukaemia the percentage of cells       
undergoing such change is lower than in normal subjects, and the        
transformation occurs more slowly .                                     
  the two phenomena are more striking the higher the initial            
leucocytosis .                                                          
  these results suggest, in chronic lymphatic leukaemia, the cells      
affected by the transformation are residual normal lymphoid elements .  
leukaemic lymphoid cells appear to be incapable of this transformation .

demonstration of ventricular aneurysms by radioisotope scanning .       
  radioisotope scanning of the cardiac blood pool after the intravenous 
injection of i -labeled iodipamide was carried out in 14 patients with  
ventricular aneurysm . in 4, the aneurysm could be demonstrated on      
neither the anteroposterior chest roentgenogram nor the scan . in 5, the
aneurysm was apparent on the radiograph, but the blood pool did not     
enter the area, suggesting a thrombus within the aneurysm . in 5, the   
aneurysm was detectable on the film and was also seen to be filled with 
radioactivity on the scan . presumably these findings showed that a     
thrombus had not yet formed . blood pool radioisotope scanning appears  
to be another tool in the diagnosis of ventricular aneurysm, useful also
in demonstrating in some patients the presence or absence of an         
intraluminal clot within the aneurysm .

propagation of lactic dehydrogenase-elevating virus in cell culture .   
  primary cultures of adult mouse lung, spleen, and liver and of mouse  
embryo support the multiplication of the lactic dehydrogenase-elevating 
virus . such cultures produced virus continuously until they had been   
subcultured 2-3 times . this corresponded to 20 weeks in the case of    
lung and spleen and to 2-3 weeks with cultures of embryo . viral        
multiplication was not accompanied by cytologic alterations in the cells
or by changes in their rate of synthesis of nucleic acids or protein .  
infection did not cause detectable changes in either the production of  
ldh or in its release from cells .

  cells of bovine embryonic lung tissue in culture were inoculated with 
simian virus 40 (sv 40) or a phenol extract of a high titer suspension  
of sv 40 . both the virus and the nucleic acid preparation induced      
proliferative morphological changes characteristic for sv 40            
transformation . non-infected control cultures and cultures which were  
inoculated with a preparation of nucleic acid exposed to dnase and      
maintained under the same conditions as infected cultures showed a      
regular fibroblastic growth .                                           
  cell lines of rapidly growing transformed cells have been obtained .

rapid transformation of human fibroblast cultures by simian virus 40 .  
  the risk of systemic embolism is assessed in a group of 754 patients  
with chronic rheumatic heart disease followed over a period of 5,833    
patient-years .                                                         
  the incidence of embolism was 1.5 per patient-year for the whole group
it was seven times higher in atrial fibrillation than in sinus rhythm 
when the duration of atrial fibrillation was known, it was found that 
one-third of the emboli occurred within one month and two-thirds within 
12 months after the onset of atrial fibrillation . the incidence of     
embolic recurrences was 8 per patient-year, irrespective of the nature  
of the cardiac rhythm, but 66 of the recurrences took place within 12   
months of the initial embolic episode .                                 
  mitral valvotomy did not eliminate the danger of embolism . it is     
questionable whether it reduced its incidence .                         
  anticoagulant treatment reduced the incidence of embolic recurrences .

attitudinal factors in congenital heart disease .                       
  this study considers the behavioral implications of congenital heart  
disease for the pediatric patient, his siblings, and his parents . the  
effects of a disease on the child, on his siblings, and on his parents  
and the interplay among these individuals are explored . the impact of  
the physician's diagnosis is illustrated by the induced significant     
changes in family attitudes, which are not necessarily related to       
disease severity or child incapacity .                                  
  poorer adjustment and anxiety in the cardiac child related more highly
to maternal anxiety and pampering than to his degree of incapacity .    
maternal protectiveness and pampering were significantly greater in the 
cardiac than in the normal group and were highest in the cyanotic group 
the best predictor of maternal protectiveness was maternal anxiety,   
and it was found that the addition of other variables such as incapacity
and child dependence failed to improve prediction substantially .       
maternal anxiety seemed related to the presence rather than to the      
severity of the heart condition .

maternal anxiety during pregnancy and adequacy of mother and child      
adjustment eight months following childbirth .                          
  fifty pregnant women were administered a battery of psychological     
tests . on the basis of scores obtained from the manifest anxiety scale,
these pregnant women were dichotomized into a /high anxiety/ group and a
/low anxiety/ group . eight months following childbirth, the mothers and
children were seen for a psychological assessment . it was found that   
the women in the /high anxious/ group evidenced significantly more      
negative childrearing attitudes . that is, the /high anxious/ mothers   
obtained significantly higher scores on the hostility and control       
factors measured by the pari . on the basis of the examiner's ratings of
the mother's personality traits, it was found that the women who were   
highly anxious during pregnancy received much less favorable personality
ratings at the time of the 8-month assessment . moreover, there was a   
significant difference in the proportions of mothers in the two groups  
who received a favorable rating from the examiner on the basis of his   
observation of the mother-child interaction during the session . in     
studying the children of these mothers, it was found that the children  
of the /low anxious/ mothers received a significantly higher            
developmental quotient on the infant mental scale . in keeping with this
finding, they also obtained a higher developmental quotient on the motor
scale, although on this aspect of the intellectual assessment the       
difference was not statistically significant . also, the children from  
the /low anxious/ mothers tended to receive a score indicative of a more
favorable general emotional tone than did the offspring of the /high    
anxious/ mothers . this difference between the two groups of children   
was not statistically significant . in general, the findings were       
consistent with the predictions that the children who were being reared 
by women who had been highly anxious during pregnancy would fare less   
well on tests of intellectual development and indices of emotional      
adjustment . the findings also were in keeping with the prediction that 
the highly anxious women during pregnancy would evidence less desirable 
parental attitudes during their child's early development and that they 
would present a less favorable personality picture at a time            
approximately 8 months following pregnancy .

maternal separation in the rhesus monkey .                              
  the present study involved separation of eight monkey mother-infant   
pairs for a period of two weeks and measurement of the behavior of the  
infants before, during and after reunion with their mothers, and of the 
mothers before and after reunion . all infants showed emotional         
disturbance in response to separation and drastic decreases in play and 
other complex social behaviors while separated .                        
  it is clear that infant-mother separation produces emotional          
disturbance in both human and macaque infants and that the patterns of  
responses following separation are similar in both species . the results
obtained in studies of monkey infant-mother separation indicate that    
sheer physical separation is the crucial aspect of maternal separation  
for monkeys . undoubtedly other factors associated with separation from 
the mother are vitally important for human children, and may account in 
part for the absence or rarity of the detachment stage (as seen in human
response pattern) in separated monkey infants . the overall results show
considerable similarity in the responses of human children and infant   
monkeys to separation from the mother .

the ophthalmologist's role in the management of dyslexia .              
  dyslexia is a clinical entity characterized by subnormal reading      
ability in a person of average or above average intelligence .          
  it is a disease which has different causes in different children . the
causes include brain damage in the /language area,/ hereditary          
predisposition and such ophthalmic factors as hyperopia, muscle         
imbalance, aniseikonia or visual immaturity . emotional disturbances,   
educational immaturity and cerebral dominance may also play some role in
the etiology of this condition .                                        
  the universal symptom is poor reading ability . however, these cases  
frequently have other associated symptoms such as poor writing,         
difficulty in reading and writing numbers, inability to read or write   
musical notes and disorientation for left and right . many of these     
patients develop personality maladjustments . visual fields often reveal
a hemianopia .                                                          
  in any group of poor readers, a large percentage will have ocular,    
neurologic, psychiatric or psychologic abnormalities and/or a strong    
hereditary tendency . the degree to which reading can be learned depends
upon the ability of the individual to adjust to the psycho-physiologic  
needs that are present at the time he reaches /reading age/ in school . 
if compensating abilities are present, and if the child's reaction is a 
favorable one, he may read well in spite of unfavorable factors,. if    
not, he may become a /poor reader/ . these children should be recognized
in their first year of school .                                         
  a complete medical work-up should be managed by an ophthalmologist . a
complete ophthalmic examination should first be performed and all       
possible visual anomalies should be corrected . the ophthalmologist may 
want a psychometric evaluation, a neurologic opinion to determine the   
role of organic brain damage, psychiatric consultation for evaluation of
emotional disturbances, pediatric consultation for evaluation of the    
status of the general health and/or consultation by an otolaryngologist 
to determine the patient's hearing ability . with all the necessary     
information at hand, the ophthalmologist will be able to recommend      
corrective medical therapy and to advise the parents and teachers about 
available remedial reading aids .                                       
  the prognosis is good for most patients since they are of average or  
above average intelligence,. nearly all cases can be helped .

frontal lobes and vision .                                              
  the influence of the frontal lobe on vision is discussed based on the 
presentation of a rather unusual case . after the operation of a right  
frontal brain abscess, which never had led to papilledema, there was a  
pronounced diminution of the visual capacities of the patient,.         
gradually these disturbances regressed to the point of return of full   
visual acuity,. but there remained a hemianopic field defect . this and 
psychological defects in the sense of a partial visual agnosia (which   
latter are also regressing very well) prompted a discussion of those    
neuroanatomical and neurophysiological observations pertinent to the    
findings in this patient . the many data on the fronto-occipital        
connections in subhuman primates point to the role of the frontal lobe  
(area 8) in the development of visual disturbances in the sense of a    
temporary hemianopia with partial visual agnosia and some intellectual  
deficits . contrary to a single observation in an anthropoid ape, our   
case would seem to indicate that the aforementioned combination of      
symptoms may originate in the frontal lobe,. and we hope it will prompt 
other long-term follow-up studies of similar patients . the continued   
observation of this patient and perhaps of others will give a           
possibility to gain insight into the role of the frontal lobe in vision,
as has been assumed for animals .

evoked response in visual disorders .                                   
  1. erg and ver have been recorded from eyelid and lateral occipital   
electrodes in response to diffuse stroboscopic stimulation . in 45      
normal subjects ver was found to be composed of an early triphasic      
potential arising from the occipital region . wave i was present in 67  
percent of subjects, wave ii in 97 percent, and wave iii in 100 percent 
later waves were inconstant and contained components from the vertex  
reference . no overall asymmetry in ver from right to left was found in 
normal subjects, although average asymmetry with smaller side compared  
to larger was 19 percent 12.5 . on monocular stimulation the            
contralateral ver was regularly larger than the ipsilateral reflecting  
predominant retinal representation of the temporal field .              
  2. a statistically determined criterion of 50 percent depression in   
wave ii successfully identifies most patients with hemianopic defects   
involving the central 10 percent of visual field on tangent screen      
campimetry .                                                            
  latency asymmetry of six msec. or more and grossly asymmetrical       
aberrant wave forms are seen in some patients with diffuse cerebral     
disease and hemianopic defects .                                        
  3. severe or diffuse retinal disease is associated with alteration or 
loss of erg and ver on stimulation of the involved eye .                
  4. optic nerve disease is indicated by bilateral loss or suppression  
of ver on stimulation of the involved eye . erg is normal .             
  5. bilateral prechiasmal involvement is associated with complete      
suppression of ver . if only waves i and ii are lost, disease is        
probably, but not conclusively, demonstrated .                          
  6. involvement of nasal retinal fibres is indicated by reversal of the
normal contralateral preponderance of ver on monocular stimulation .    
these changes are observed in chiasmal disease .                        
  7. retrogeniculate blindness is associated with loss of early ver and 
preservation of late response . nonspecific projections are felt to     
contribute to the late cortical response to photic stimulation .

optokinetic nystagmus and occipital lesions .                           
  six cases are presented to invalidate the rule that horizontally      
symmetric optokinetic responses indicate a vascular etiology in patients
with occipital lobe type hemianopias . the converse of this rule is, in 
our experience, still a valuable observation . that is, asymmetry of    
horizontal optokinetic responses accompanying an occipital type field   
defect is a strong indication of a mass lesion . optokinetic nystagmus  
may be helpful, therefore, as corroborative evidence in diagnosing      
occipital lobe tumor but not in ruling it out .

disturbances of the verbal body image.. a particular syndrome of sensory
aphasia .                                                               
  1. the pto syndrome of the dominant hemisphere varies according to the
extent and depth of the lesion in the angular and supramarginal areas . 
the mildest clinical syndrome consists of a vague contralateral sensory 
impairment associated with dyscalculia, dysgraphia, dyslexia and        
difficulty in naming . a more extensive lesion is needed to cause the   
wide variety of classical signs described in parietal lobe disease,     
among them being gerstmann's syndrome, which is usually found in        
association with other manifestations of parietal loss (case 1) . an    
even more extensive corticosubcortical lesion in the area leads to      
complete disintegration of naming and understanding of speech (cases 3, 
4 and 5) .                                                              
  2. attention is drawn to the difficulties arising from lack of        
differentiation between the concrete gnostic body image and the abstract
verbal body image in investigation of these patients . the aphasic      
syndrome should be differentiated from disturbances of gnosis by        
application of separate, non-verbal methods of testing to elicit the    
impairment of the gnostic body image . the latter may be well           
compensated for and it is apparently unimpaired in the presence of an   
aphasic syndrome limited to the verbal body image .                     
  3. disturbances of speech in pto lesions if investigated along        
quantitative scales of impairment of repetition, understanding and      
naming, show a regular interrelation . nomination is the most affected, 
understanding is less affected . repetition is the best preserved       
function (cases 1-4) . the same interrelation of these functions is     
found with regard to the verbal body image . however, understanding and 
naming of parts of the body show far greater disintegration than        
understanding and naming of any other categories of words (all cases    
presented here) . if the aphasic syndrome is subsiding, finger aphasia  
with some other minor disturbances of verbal body image associated with 
acalculia may persist (case 1) . thus gerstmann's /finger agnosia/ may  
represent a partial impairment of the verbal body image and be limited  
to finger aphasia .                                                     
  4. it is assumed that the verbal body image differs from other        
categories of verbal symbols owing to the mainly proprioceptive,        
vestibular and tactile experience forming its specific physiologic      
background . telereceptive experience is of minor importance in the     
initial development of the understanding of words defining the body     
image .                                                                 
  in the patients described here, the selectively worse aphasic         
impairment of the verbal body image, as compared with other categories  
of words, seem to confirm this assumption .

chromosomal patterns in cancer patients during treatment .              
  radiation damages the chromosomes of human cells, and through         
short-term cultures of white blood cells some of this damage can be     
assessed . patients with cancer were selected for this study because of 
the large portions of the blood-forming tissues irradiated in the course
of treatment . chromosomal damage may be quantitative with variations   
from the normal number of 46, or qualitative, thereby showing structural
aberrations . counting the chromosomes in cells from cultures grown     
prior to therapy and at intervals during treatment enables us to        
determine the variation .                                               
  stained preparations examined microscopically allow us to recognize   
these abnormalities which are apparent before, during, and after        
radiotherapy . the damage appears to be largely random in the           
chromosomes affected in the different cancers, and the specific         
aberrations differ from cell to cell . however, there does seem to be   
some correlation between the appearance of persistent aberrant          
chromosomes and their frequency . while the peak incidence or /plateau/ 
may remain unchanged, the frequency may change .

a few interesting neurologic manifestations of migraine .               
  migraine is a complex vascular phenomenon presumably of genetic origin
which, through changes induced by either vasoconstriction or            
vasodilitation, can produce interference with the neurologic system and 
result in many bizarre and alarming clinical pictures . a few examples  
of the more interesting neurologic manifestations have been shown .

visual neglect .                                                        
  clinical trainees in nursing and in psychology from boston college and
simmons college, boston, mass., collected data and observed patients    
under the direction of the authors in a pilot program designed to       
measure visual spatial neglect and to develop rehabilitative material . 
these measurements and exercises might also be used by nurses in their  
care of those patients who have had cerebral vascular accidents .       
  the diversity of daily activities in which the patient becomes        
involved during his hospitalization should provide some indication of   
the extent to which the compensatory visual neglect therapeutics have   
been effective . more formal estimates can be obtained by               
re-administering the battery of visual neglect tests at periodic        
intervals . nursing personnel adopting a program of therapeutics such as
this must bear in mind that patients suffering cerebral insult are      
usually less adaptive than their nonbrain-injured peers . they develop  
new habit patterns slowly and regression often will follow apparent     
fixation at a more adaptive level of response habituation(11) . however,
experimental inquiry has shown that the dimension of behavioral         
difference between the brain-injured adults and normal adults is one of 
degree rather than kind -dash a difference that skilled nursing can     
often reduce(12) .

respiratory changes after open-heart surgery .                          
  patients who undergo cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation  
develop significant alveolar-arterial oxygen tension differences and    
venous admixture in the early post-operative period . up to 50 of this  
abnormality is due to anatomical right to left shunting through the     
lungs.. the remainder is most likely to be due to ventilation-perfusion 
inequality . the changes appear to be completely reversible . the       
cardiopulmonary bypass procedure may be responsible for initiating the  
underlying pathology, since changes of this magnitude were not found in 
cardiothoracic surgery patients in whom this technique was not required

cardiac malformations associated with ventricular septal defect .       
  in this study, 46 necropsy-proved cases of ventricular septal defect  
associated with another anomaly but not part of a recognized complex    
were selected .                                                         
  the associated anomalies were classified as (1) obstructive or        
positional anomalies of the great vessels, (2) anomalies responsible for
additional shunts, (3) anomalies causing intraventricular obstruction   
and (4) aortic valvular insufficiency .                                 
  clinical findings were often those of the ventricular septal defect,  
and the findings related to the associated lesion were frequently       
obscure . even with special studies, including cardiac catheterization  
and angiocardiography, there was often failure to arrive at a complete  
diagnosis . the findings which led to an erroneous or incomplete        
diagnosis have been presented . when a complete diagnosis was made      
preoperatively, the procedures leading to it have been outlined . while 
the diagnostic approach varies with the malformations which may coexist 
with ventricular septal defect, it was observed that aortography and    
selective left ventricular angiocardiography were most commonly helpful 
in identifying occult malformations associated with ventricular septal  
defect . it is therefore recommended that complete studies, including   
left-sided cardiac catheterization with left ventricular                
angiocardiography and aortography, should be considered in all cases in 
which the clinical, electrocardiographic, and right-sided cardiac       
catheterization studies are not entirely typical for isolated           
ventricular septal defect .

anatomic types of single or common ventricle in man morphologic and     
geometric aspects of 60 necropsied cases .                              
  in 60 necropsied cases of single or common ventricle in man, four     
major unrelated ventricular malformations were found.. (1) absence of   
the right ventricular sinus, in 47 cases (78 percent), designated type  
a,. (2) absence of the left ventricular sinus, in 3 cases (5 percent),  
type b,. (3) absence or rudimentary development of the ventricular      
septum, in 4 cases (7 percent), type c,. and (4) absence of both        
ventricular sinuses and of the ventricular septum, in 6 cases (10       
percent), type d .                                                      
  three types of relationship between the great arteries were present.. 
a normal (solitus) interrelationship, in 9 cases (15 percent),          
designated type 1,. d-transposition, the transposed aortic valve lying  
to the right (dextro, or d), relative to the transposed pulmonary valve,
in 25 cases (42 percent), type ii,. and l-transposition, the transposed 
aortic valve lying to the left (levo or l), relative to the transposed  
pulmonary valve, in 26 cases (43 percent), type iii . in none was the   
inversus interrelationship, type iv, displayed .                        
  three types of visceral and atrial situs were found.. solitus, or     
normal, in 50 cases (83 percent),. inversus, an exact apparent mirror   
image of normal, in 2 cases (3 percent),. and heterotaxy, the uncertain 
visceral and atrial situs associated with asplenia, in 8 cases (13      
percent) .                                                              
  the 60 cases were classified segmentally, according to the anatomy of 
the three cardiac segments.. the great arteries, the ventricular        
sinuses, and the atria .                                                
  the classic single ventricle with a rudimentary outlet chamber was    
found morphologically to be a large left ventricle with a right         
ventricular infundibulum, the sinus of the right ventricle being absent 
(type a) .                                                              
  the myocardium of the right ventricular infundibulum, of the right    
ventricular sinus, and of the left ventricular sinus was identified by  
the distinctive gross morphologic characteristics of each .             
  the planes of the atrial and ventricular septa, and the relationships 
between the great arteries at the semilunar valves, were measured as    
projections upon the horizontal plane, relative to the anteroposterior  
line .                                                                  
  an approach to cardiac anatomy is presented which is segmental,       
morphologic and geometric . this approach has angiocardiographic,       
electrocardiographic and embryologic applications .

congenital heart disease in the adult .                                 
  events in the natural course of 310 adult patients with proved        
significant congenital cardiac anomalies have been reviewed to determine
incidence, longevity, complications and cause of death .                
  atrial septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus were the most       
frequently encountered lesions and comprised over one third of the      
entire series . ventricular septal defect and pulmonic stenosis made up 
almost a quarter of the group . twenty-two instances of the eisenmenger 
syndrome secondary to a variety of shunting lesions are included .      
  bacterial endocarditis, sudden death and cardiac decompensation were  
the greatest threats to these patients . symptoms were minimal until the
appearance of heart failure, which was the most common cause of death,  
especially with older patients . sudden death occurred most often in    
patients with ventricular septal defect .                               
  although the clinical features are usually characteristic of a        
congenital malformation, young adults with acyanotic congenital heart   
disease are often misdiagnosed as rheumatic,. and in older patients,    
presenting manifestations are frequently attributed to arteriosclerotic 
heart disease . at times an associated acquired cardiovascular disorder 
may alter the basic syndrome .                                          
  three quarters of the patients survive and continue under observation 
the ability of many to live active, productive lives and to withstand 
stress, surgery, both cardiac and non-cardiac, and pregnancy was        
impressive . further observation of the patient with congenital heart   
disease but without surgical intervention is essential for accurate     
evaluation of the long term efficacy of cardiac surgery .

  clinical, electrocardiographic, radiographic, and hemodynamic findings
in 12 children with the combination of a ventricular septal defect and  
aortic insufficiency are presented . the left-to-right shunt was        
determined to be small or moderate in all, and significant aortic       
insufficiency was documented by aortography in 11 patients . clinical   
indication of aortic insufficiency as manifested by an aortic diastolic 
murmur first appeared at an average age of 6 years in 7 patients, with  
concomitant widening of the pulse pressure in 4 . progressive left      
ventricular hypertrophy was noted electrocardiographically, with        
progressive cardiac hypertrophy and aortic dilatation on x-ray          
examination in 2 patients . progression of the hemodynamic disability   
does not appear to be common in childhood, however .

ventricular septal defect and aortic regurgitation clinical, hemodynamic
and surgical considerations .                                           
  the clinical, hemodynamic, angiographic and anatomic findings in      
fifteen patients with ventricular septal defect complicated by aortic   
regurgitation are presented . in this combination of malformations the  
aortic regurgitation is acquired and results from prolapse of an aortic 
valve leaflet into the septal defect . the strategic location of the    
septal defect in relation to the aortic leaflets appears to be more     
important to the development of this complication than the size of the  
defect or the magnitude of the shunt through it . the onset of aortic   
regurgitation occurs during early childhood and, once present, tends to 
become more severe . careful observation of patients with these defects 
is indicated following the appearance of aortic regurgitation since     
rapid progression to severe left ventricular failure is not uncommon .  
ventricular septal defect and aortic regurgitation must be distinguished
from other cardiovascular abnormalities producing a wide pulse pressure 
with a continuous or to-and-fro murmur . cardiac catheterization and    
thoracic aortography are the diagnostic procedures most helpful in this 
differentiation . the operative treatment of ventricular septal defect  
and aortic regurgitation is reviewed and, on the basis of the present   
and previously reported results, suggested plans for surgical management
are presented .

current techniques in the surgical approach to aortic and mitral

  1. the aortic and mitral valves can be operated upon successfully and 
totally replaced with a prosthetic device of the ball-valve type with   
good long-term results . seventy-four cases are reported .              
  2. in aortic valvular disease the outcome in the immediate            
postoperative period is influenced primarily by the presence of calcific
aortic stenosis as well as the presence or absence of disease in the    
coronary arteries .                                                     
  3. we have significantly decreased the appearance of a low-output     
syndrome postoperatively in patients who are suffering from severe      
mitral disease by leaving the papillary muscle-chordae tendineae-mural  
leaflet relationship intact . we feel this adds strength to each        
contraction .

effects of aortic regurgitation on left ventricular performance direct  
determinations of aortic blood flow before and after valve replacement .
  the volume of regurgitant blood flow and its effects on the           
performance of the left ventricle were assessed at operation in 14      
patients with varying degrees of aortic regurgitation . instantaneous   
forward and regurgitant flows in the ascending aorta were measured with 
a sine-wave electromagnetic flowmeter simultaneously with left          
ventricular and aortic pressures . in eight patients who had aortic     
regurgitation without associated stenosis, 63 to 75 percent of the total
forward stroke volume regurgitated during the succeeding diastole . the 
calculated regurgitant orifice areas ranged from 0.13 to 0.44 cm /m .   
after replacement of the aortic valve with a starr-edwards prosthesis,  
the absence of regurgitant flow was proved in every patient, and the    
records of aortic blood flow closely resembled those seen in patients   
with normal aortic valves . net forward blood flow increased by an      
average of 60 percent, total left ventricular stroke volume fell 42     
percent, and the mean aortic pressure rose 29 percent . the pressure    
work of the left ventricle was elevated preoperatively in five of the   
eight patients (average 89 g-m stroke/m ) and fell significantly to an  
average of 34 g-m stroke m after valve replacement . kinetic ventricular
work was high in seven of the eight patients and comprised 10 percent of
total work before replacement but only 4.8 percent afterward .          
  similar observations were made in five patients with aortic stenosis  
and associated aortic regurgitation, ranging in severity from 24 to 72  
percent of total forward stroke volume . in four patients in whom the   
valve was replaced, no residual regurgitation was present afterward, and
net forward flow rose an average of 49 percent . kinetic left           
ventricular work was extremely high in every patient and averaged 26    
percent of total work preoperatively and 13 percent after valve         
replacement . in this group, pressure work was variable both before and 
after operation .                                                       
  the studies described provide definitive information concerning the   
effects of aortic valve disease on left ventricular performance in man  
and document the favorable changes in flow, pressure, and left          
ventricular work which immediately follow aortic valve replacement .

the absorption and hepatic uptake of orally ingested radioactive vitamin
b in hepato-splenic bilharziasis .                                      
  the absorbed plasma radioactivity and hepatic uptake of orally        
ingested vitamin b tagged with co were measured in 52 subjects, 26      
normals and 26 suffering from bilharziasis .

bilharziasis irrespective of the stage of the disease, the size of the  
organs affected and the presence or absence of associated peripheral    
neuritis .

early effects of digitalis on central hemodynamics in normal subjects .

  1. an early significant reduction of heart rate .                     
  2. a significant transient reduction of cardiac output .              
  3. a significant increase of the stroke volume initially accompanied  
by a significant rise of the end-diastolic volume with unchanged        
systolic rate of emptying . the increase of end-diastolic volume seems  
to be related to the lengthening of the diastolic filling period . later
on, the systolic emptying rate increases, and the ventricular volumes   
decrease, suggesting an inotropic effect of the drug .                  
  4. a significant increase of pulmonary blood volume, parallel to the  
increase of the stroke volume, suggestive of a passive relation between 
the two variables .

  in 23 patients undergoing open-heart surgery in whom the pericardial  
contents were accurately measured, and in 11 additional patients        
examined at autopsy or by pericardiocentesis, isotopic photoscans of the
heart were made and the results were correlated .                       
  the most accurate means of diagnosis of pericardial effusion was found
to be the ratio of the maximum transverse cardiac diameters on scan and 
roentgenogram . in patients with less than 100 cc of pericardial fluid  
this ratio was greater than 0.80, and it was less than this in cases of 
effusion of 200 cc or more .                                            
  measurement of the difference of these diameters, and visible         
separation of the cardiac blood pool from the pulmonary vasculature and 
liver aided in the diagnosis .                                          
  pericardial effusions of 200-300 cc or greater can be detected by     
isotopic photoscanning . although cardiac dilatation and/or hypertrophy 
decrease the sensitivity of the technique somewhat, a definite diagnosis
of pericardial effusion can be made even when cardiomegaly exists .

aneurysm of the membranous septum .                                     
  1. aneurysms of the membranous septum are relatively rare lesions     
presumably developing on a congenital basis . these aneurysms originate 
in the left ventricle immediately beneath the aortic valve and bulge    
into the right ventricle, the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve or  
into the right atrium .                                                 
  2. many of these aneurysms do not produce symptoms . others may cause 
right ventricular outflow tract obstruction or may rupture and result in
a septal defect . the resulting shunt will be from the left ventricle   
into the right atrium or ventricle .                                    
  3. an aneurysm of the membranous septum may be an isolated abnormality
or be associated with other congenital cardiac defects, particularly    
aortic valvular insufficiency . membranous septal aneurysms may be the  
site of bacterial endocarditis or thrombus formation .                  
  4. aneurysms resembling those arising from the membranous septum may  
occur as part of the complex of deformities produced by an endocardial  
cushion defect . however, the angiographic features diagnostic of a     
cushion defect can still be recognized .

distribution of transfused tritiated cytidine-labeled leukocytes and red
cells in the bone marrow of normal and irradiated rat .                 
  in normal rats and after total body irradiation with 550 r of x-rays, 
the fate in the bone marrow of labeled nucleated and red cells of       
transfused peripheral blood was observed autoradiographically .         
  labeled nucleated cells, most of which were lymphocyte-like cells,    
readily migrated into the marrow parenchyma in normal animals (2 cells/ 
1,000 parenchymal cells/hr.) . following irradiation to at least 27-51  
hr., this migration appeared to be relatively increased . beyond this   
time, parenchymal areas were more difficult to be defined as such .     
  labeled red cells were rarely observed to enter parenchyma despite the
presence of nonlabeled erythrocytes within the parenchymal structure    
after irradiation .                                                     
  the vascular bed following irradiation increased greatly as the       
parenchyma diminished to a minimum of less than 10 percent control at 75
hr . despite these changes in the architecture of the marrow, the       
average density of labeled cells per area of marrow corresponded to     
values expected on the assumption of a free-flowing circulation . the   
technique used at present did not allow us to distinguish, at all times,
between a free-flowing circulation through intact sinusoids or through  
areas in which the sinusoidal wall, as such, was destroyed .

factors limiting survival after circulatory occlusion under hypothermia

  thirty minutes of circulatory occlusion with mild hypothermia and     
hyperbaric oxygen ventilation resulted in a mortality of 83.3 percent in
animals . when coronary perfusion from a reservoir was added, the       
mortality rate was 22 percent . ventricular fibrillation was much more  
easily reversed after coronary perfusion . there was no evidence of     
brain damage in survivors which leads to the conclusion that the brain  
tolerates circulatory arrest better than the heart under these          
conditions .

  total circulatory occlusion and release result in hemodynamic         
phenomena which provide an index of integrity of some cardiovascular    
reflexes . these include carotid sinus and aortic baroceptors,          
arteriolar vasomotor tone, and venomotor reactivity .                   
  baroceptor depression appears at a more moderate level of cooling than
does the sympathetic, vasomotor, depression . below 28 degrees c. both  
are significantly depressed, although probably not totally abolished .  
  the level of 28 degrees c. is a critical physiological level and may  
represent an important limit in the clinical use of hypothermia .

studies in perfusion hypothermia with special reference to /deep        
hypothermia/ and circulatory arrest .                                   
  1. perfusion hypothermia produces large temperature gradients within  
the body since organs are cooled roughly in proportion to their basal   
blood flows . the difference between the coldest and the warmest portion
of the body after 30 minutes of perfusion exceeds 25 c .                
  2. the average body temperature, which provides a proper measure of   
total body cooling, may be calculated from the arteriovenous temperature
difference and the extracorporeal flow rate .                           
  3. true /deep/ hypothermia is not obtainable by reasonable periods of 
perfusion alone .                                                       
  4. an important rise of core temperatures occurs during circulatory   
arrest in hypothermia because of relatively high average body           
temperature .                                                           
  5. high average body temperatures lead to continuing production of    
lactic acid in muscle tissue, whereas low core temperatures impair      
lactic acid metabolism . thus metabolic acidosis is progressive in      
prolonged perfusion hypothermia, and is accentuated by total circulatory
arrest . progressive acidosis may be minimized by uniform profound      
cooling by combining external with perfusion hypothermia .              
  6 diluents appear to have little effect on total body heat exchange   
during perfusion cooling .                                              
  7. perfusion warming has a differentially greater effect on core      
organs . though these are readily brought to a normal range, much of the
animal may remain cold .

nickel carbonyl.. its detection and potential for formation .           
  recent recommendations for control of nickel carbonyl exposures have  
been considered in the design of a simple, sensitive field method for   
sampling nickel carbonyl in air and process gases . the method involves 
collection in dilute aqueous hcl, ph adjustment, nickel complex         
development with alpha-furildioxime, and extraction with chloroform .   
color intensity is compared visually (or for greater accuracy,          
spectrophotometrically) with liquid standards . sensitivities on the    
order of 0.001 ppm are obtainable . a detailed development of the       
thermodynamics associated with the formation of nickel carbonyl is also 
presented to show the maximum concentrations of nickel carbonyl that may
be formed over a wide range of co concentrations, temperatures and      
pressures .

emission spectrography .                                                
  x-ray emission spectrography has been applied to study of the         
elemental composition of human teeth, enamel, dentine and bone . the    
material consisted of eight crushed teeth, enamel and dentine powder    
separated from eighteen teeth, and four pieces of buccal cortical       
mandibular bone . the teeth did not have fillings . the whole material  
contained nineteen elements, of which the main ones were calcium and    
phosphorus . in all the samples of tooth material, there were found ca, 
p, cl, fe, zn, sr and k, and the bone also contained ni . the time      
needed for a semi-quantitative analysis compares very favourably with   
that needed for other methods .

a kinetic study of nickel(ii), complexes of sulfur-containing amino acid
  the rate expression for the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta)    
ligand exchange reaction with nickel(cysteine) is.. rate = k(complex) + 
kedta (complex)(edta) . this two-term rate expression is characteristic 
of square planar complexes and agrees with the square planar            
configuration of ni(cysteine) reported on the basis of spectral studies 
the edta-independent term of the rate expression is an acid-catalyzed 
term and can be written k (h) (complex) . the value of kn is 2.5 x 10 m 
sec while the value of kedta is only on the order of 10 -10 m sec . the 
edta reaction with ni(cysteine) methyl ester) is very similar to the    
reaction with ni(cysteine) . when the sulfur-containing amino acid      
ligand contains a thiol ether, the kinetic differences are striking .   
  ligand exchange reactions of edta, triethylenetetramine, and          
diethylenetriamine with nickel-methionine complexes are several orders  
of magnitude faster and give products that are mixed-ligand complexes . 
the results of this kinetic study of amino acid complexes containing    
sulfhydryl and thiol ether sulfur groups support other studies at       
equilibrium which suggest sulfur coordination and square planar         
complexes for the sulfhydryl groups and octahedral complexes with no    
sulfur coordination for thiol ethers .

the action of metal ions on tobacco mosaic virus ribonucleic acid .     
  added transition metal ions stabilize the secondary structure of      
tobacco mosaic virus ribonucleic acid (tmv-rna) as evidenced by a       
reduction in the absorbancy change of heated nucleic acid solutions . in
spite of this stabilization of secondary structure, heating in the      
presence of metal ions results in the loss of biological activity due to
the hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds . thus, all heavy metal ions of  
the iib and first-transition elements studied caused a rapid loss of    
biological activity of tmv-rna at ph 6.5 and 65 . calcium and magnesium 
ions, while not affecting secondary structure at 65 and ph 8.5, caused a
rapid loss of biological activity . at ph 5.8 and room temperature lead 
ions catalyzed the hydrolysis of rna to i'(3')- mononucleotides,. on    
long standing, nucleosides were formed .

mortality, tumors and tissue levels .                                   
  about 700 mice were given throughout their lives 5 ppm cadmium, lead, 
chromium, nickel or titanium in drinking water while fed a diet         
deficient in cadmium and low in other metals . tissue concentrations    
comparable to those of man were observed . sex differences appeared .   
mortality of females was unaffected . mortality of males on cadmium,    
lead and nickel was increased compared with that of the chromium group, 
and of those on cadmium and lead compared with the controls . longevity 
of the oldest 10 of both sexes was less in lead and titanium groups, and
of males in cadmium group, compared with controls . no metal was        
carcinogenic,. incidence of tumors in males on cadmium and lead, and in 
females given nickel was decreased . body weights at death were greater 
in titanium, chromium and lead groups . large increments of titanium,   
moderate increments of cadmium and nickel, and lesser increments of     
chromium and lead were observed in 5 organs, compared with controls .   
higher concentrations of cadmium and titanium occurred in younger mice  
and the other metals did not increase markedly in tissues with age . all
metals except chromium exhibited one or more signs of innate toxicity .

synergistic effects between antioxidants and selenium or vitamin e .

the compounds were toxic, as evidenced by sudden death or subcutaneous  
hemorrhages . when amounts of either selenite or a-tocopheryl acetate,  
which individually had little or no effect on symptoms, were given with 
the antioxidants signs of deficiency and mortality were prevented, and

responses of b. subtilis (atcc 558) to streptomycin .                   
  to observe in detail the influence of streptomycin on the growth of sm
dependent type, the author chose b. subtilis (atcc 558) and made        
experiments on its responses to streptomycin, with special reference to 
the relation of the sm concentration with spore formation of its sm     
dependent type together with germination and outgrowth of the spores    
formed . the results are as follows .                                   
  1. among 18x10 cells of wild type of b. subtilis (atcc 558) about     
3,200 cells of sm resistant and one cell of sm dependent are found as   
its mutant .                                                            
  2. b. substilis (atcc 558) shows normal growth at sm concentration    
below 10 r/ml, but the growth declines rapidly between sm 10 r/ml-20 r/m
l, and the growth stops entirely at sm concentration 20 r/ml .          
  3. sm resistant type grows well between sm 0.1 r/ml-sm 2,000 r/ml, the
growth declines rapidly at about sm 10,000 r/ml .                       
  4. sm dependent type shows normal growth between sm 10,000 r/ml-20 r/m
l, the growth get worth below sm 10 r/ml, and the cell shape elongates  
several times, at sm below 1 r/ml each cell becomes filamentous form and
has several ten times length of normal cell, as if the cells have       
stopped to divide at low sm concentration .                             
  6. the germination and outgrowth of spores of the sm dependent type   
slow down with decline of sm concentration, but the germinated spores   
grow in normal forms until sm concentration reaches 7.8 r/ml, then the  
germination becomes much slower, and the cells grow in filamentous forms
or irregular forms . at extremely low sm concentration both germination 
and outgrowth nearly stop .

  in the present study, lenses were removed from the eyes of adult      
anesthetized newts, macerated in 0.03 m borate buffer at ph 8.6, and    
separated by starch gel electrophoresis . upon staining with amido black
10-b, seven distinct staining areas appeared in the blocks . three bands
moved toward the anode, and three toward the cathode . in addition, a   
seventh moiety represented by a smear of material moved toward the anode
one millimeter times five tenths millimeter plugs were removed from   
each of these areas and were placed into freshly lentectomized eyes .   
plugs from most strongly positive and most weakly negative proteins     
inhibited lens regeneration . in addition, plugs from the area          
containing the weakly negative protein induced either lenses with       
aberrant polarity or double centered lenses with centers of opposed     
polarity . all other protein bands had no significant effect on

proteinasedigested homogenates of lenses were injected into eyes        
following lentectomy . three 5-ul samples were injected in each case

  a partially single-stranded dna, prepared by limited digestion of each
strand with exonuclease iii, can be restored to its native, fully       
double-stranded structure by escherichia coli dna polymerase . the rate 
of synthesis observed in the repair of such a partially degraded primer

the newly synthesized dna is covalently attached to the primer . the    
fully repaired dna resembles the original native dna as judged by its   
appearance in electron micrographs, cscl density-gradient analysis,     
denaturability and genetic activity . dna synthesis which follows the   
repair phase produces a structure that is not covalently linked to the  
primer and resembles, in its nondenaturability, branched appearance, and
lack of genetic activity, the product obtained with a native dna primer

  the molecular fate of transforming dna in competent bacillus subtilis 
has been studied . the physical differentiation of transforming dna and 
the genetic material of recipient bacteria was effected by employing the
isotopes n and p . competent bacteria labeled with n and p were allowed 
to incorporate n p-labeled transforming dna intracellularly . dna was   
isolated from these recipient cells and centrifuged in cesium chloride .
analysis of drop fractions collected at equilibrium showed the presence 
of radioactivity in a region of density corresponding to recipient dna .
material contribution from donor dna to the resident dna did not occur  
when genetically inert bacillus cereus dna was substituted for          
homologous dna . it was concluded that radioactivity appearing in the   
unlabeled resident dna was not the result of degradation of input (     
p)dna and subsequent incorporation by normal metabolic processes . since
single-stranded dna of donor origin was not detected, nor was there     
evidence for the non-specific aggregation of donor and recipient dna, it
was concluded that the observed physical association of transforming and
recipient dna occurs as a result of genetic recombination in transformed
b. subtilis .

bacillus subtilis transforming dna treated by low ph, nitrous acid, or  
hydroxylamine at different temperatures . the frequency of mutants      
increased linearly with time for all three agents, whereas the logarithm
of survival gave a linear plot only for nitrous acid and low ph . an    
arrhenius plot showed the same slopes for both inactivation and mutation
rates after treatment with low ph or nitrous acid,. for the latter agent
the slope remained unaltered even when the dna was treated in the

hormone therapy in metastatic breast cancer.. clinical response and

  the total urinary gonadotrophin output of a group of post menopausal  
women with metastatic breast carcinoma undergoing hormone therapy, which
in every case initially consisted of treatment with diethylstilboestrol,
des (ca. 20 mg/d), has been studied for periods varying from seven      
months to 31/2 years .                                                  
  no correlation between gonadotrophin output and clinical response was 
found, except that in all cases showing objective regression urinary    
gonadotrophin remained low throughout the remission period . a low level
of gonadotrophin output was not, however, necessarily indicative of a   
good clinical remission . following withdrawal of des, and independent  
of the period of therapy, recovery to pre-treatment levels was the rule 
rather than the exception .                                             
  a small group of patients maintained on a lower dose of des (3-5 mg/d)
showed the same degree of suppression of urinary output as those        
receiving 20 mg/d, and several of these exhibited objective remissions .
  the study has emphasised the importance of site specificity in the    
response to hormone therapy, and underlines the difficulties of relating
the clinical response of the patient as a whole to changes in hormonal  
environment .

  an experimental study of a wing in a propeller slipstream was
made in order to determine the spanwise distribution of the lift
increase due to slipstream at different angles of attack of the wing
and at different free stream to slipstream velocity ratios .  the
results were intended in part as an evaluation basis for different
theoretical treatments of this problem .
  the comparative span loading curves, together with
supporting evidence, showed that a substantial part of the lift increment
produced by the slipstream was due to a /destalling/ or
boundary-layer-control effect .  the integrated remaining lift
increment, after subtracting this destalling lift, was found to agree
well with a potential flow theory .
  an empirical evaluation of the destalling effects was made for

simple shear flow past a flat plate in an incompressible fluid of small
viscosity .
in the study of high-speed viscous flow past a two-dimensional body it
is usually necessary to consider a curved shock wave emitting from the
nose or leading edge of the body .  consequently, there exists an
inviscid rotational flow region between the shock wave and the boundary
layer .  such a situation arises, for instance, in the study of the
hypersonic viscous flow past a flat plate .  the situation is somewhat
different from prandtl's classical boundary-layer problem . in prandtl's
original problem the inviscid free stream outside the boundary layer is
irrotational while in a hypersonic boundary-layer problem the inviscid
free stream must be considered as rotational .  the possible effects of
vorticity have been recently discussed by ferri and libby .  in the
present paper, the simple shear flow past a flat plate in a fluid of small
viscosity is investigated .  it can be shown that this problem can again
be treated by the boundary-layer approximation, the only novel feature
being that the free stream has a constant vorticity .  the discussion
here is restricted to two-dimensional incompressible steady flow .

the effect of controlled three-dimensional roughness
on boundary layer transition at supersonic speeds .
  experiments were performed in the 12-in. supersonic wind
tunnel of the jet propulsion laboratory of the california
institute of technology to investigate the effect of three-dimensional
roughness elements (spheres) on boundary-layer transition on a
tained at local mach numbers of 1.90, 2.71, and 3.67 by varying
trip size, position, spacing, and reynolds number per inch .
the results indicate that (1) transition from laminar to turbulent
flow induced by three-dimensional roughness elements begins
when the double row of spiral vortices trailing each element
contaminates and breaks down the surrounding field of vorticity, (2)
transition appears rather suddenly, becoming more violent with
increasing roughness height relative to the boundary-layer
thickness, (3) after the breakdown of the vorticity field, the strength
of the spiral vortices may still persist in the sublayer of the
ensuing turbulent flow, (4) lateral spacing of roughness elements has
little effect upon the initial breakdown (contamination) of the
laminar flow, and (5) the trip reynolds number where u
and v are the velocity and kinematic viscosity at the outer edge of
the boundary layer and k is roughness height, such that transition
occurs at the roughness position, varies as the position reynolds
number to the one-fourth power, viz., where x is
trip position .

  an investigation of transition and skin friction on an insulated
flat plate, 5 by 26 in., was made in the galcit 5 by 5 in.
hypersonic wind tunnel at a nominal mach number of 5.8 .
  the phosphorescent lacquer technique was used for transition
detection and was found to be in good agreement with total-head
rake measurements along the plate surface and pitot boundary-
layer surveys .  it was found that the boundary layer was
laminar at reynolds numbers of at least 5 x 10 .  transverse
contamination caused by the turbulent boundary layer on the
tunnel sidewall originated far downstream of the flat plate leading
edge at reynolds numbers of 1.5 to 2 x 10, and spread at a
uniform angle of 5 compared to 9 degree in low-speed flow .
  the effect of two-dimensional and local disturbances was
investigated .  the technique of air injection into the boundary
layer as a means of hastening transition was extensively used .
although the onset of transition occurred at reynolds numbers
as low as 10, a fully developed turbulent boundary layer was
not obtained at reynolds numbers much below 2 x 10
regardless of the amount of air injected .
  a qualitative discussion of these results is given with emphasis
on the possibility of a greater stability of the laminar boundary
layer in hypersonic flow than at lower speeds .
  direct skin-friction measurements were made by means of the
floating element technique, over a range of reynolds numbers
verified as being laminar over the complete range .  with air
injection, turbulent shear was obtained only for reynolds
numbers greater than 2 x 10, this value being in good agreement with
earlier results of this investigation .  the turbulent skin-friction
coefficient was found to be approximately 0.40 of that for
incompressible flow for a constant value of r, and 0.46 for an effective
reynolds number between 5 and 6 x 10 .

piston theory - a new aerodynamic tool for the

  representative applications are described which illustrate the
extent to which simplifications in the solutions of high-speed
unsteady aeroelastic problems can be achieved through the use of
certain aerodynamic techniques known collectively as /piston
theory ./  based on a physical model originally proposed by
hayes and lighthill, piston theory for airfoils and finite wings
has been systematically developed by landahl, utilizing
expansions in powers of the thickness ratio and the inverse of the
flight mach number m .  when contributions of orders and
are negligible, the theory predicts a point-function
relationship between the local pressure on the surface of a wing and the
normal component of fluid velocity produced by the wing's
motion .  the computation of generalized forces in aeroelastic
equations, such as the flutter determinant, is then always
reduced to elementary integrations of the assumed modes of motion .
  essentially closed-form solutions are given for the bending-
torsion and control-surface flutter properties of typical section
airfoils at high mach numbers .  these agree well with results of
more exact theories wherever comparisons can be fairly made .
moreover, they demonstrate the increasingly important influence
of thickness and profile shape as m grows larger, a discovery that
would be almost impossible using other available aerodynamic
tools .  the complexity of more practical flutter analyses-e.g., on
three-dimensional wings and panels-is shown to be substantially
reduced by piston theory .  an iterative procedure is outlined, by
which improved flutter eigenvalues can be found through the
successive introduction of higher-order terms in and  .
  other applications to unsteady supersonic problems are
reviewed, including gust response and rapid maneuvers of elastic
aircraft .  steady-state aeroelastic calculations are also discussed,
but for them piston theory amounts only to a slight modification
of ackeret's formulas .
  suggestions are made regarding future research based on the
new aerodynamic method, with particular emphasis on areas where
computational labor can be reduced with a minimum loss of
precision .  it is pointed out that a mach number zone exists where
thermal effects are appreciable but nonlinear viscous interactions
may be neglected, and that in this zone piston theory is the logical
way of estimating air loads when analyzing aerodynamic-
thermoelastic interaction problems .

is not required .  a key point in the analysis is the modification
of the stream function to include a mean of the fluctuating
components and the postulate that the apparent turbulent shear,
associated with an elemental mass, remains invariant in the
transformation .
  the values of the incompressible friction coefficients and of

in connection with a study of the wakes behind bodies in hypersonic flow
carried out for the missile and space vehicle division of the general

axisymmetric, compressible wakes .  because of the lack of applicable
experimental data, it was found necessary to make such an estimate by
rationally extending the few available data for incompressible flows to
the compressible case .  this suggested the application and extension of
the transformations applied to turbulent boundary layers in reference
infinitesimal mass are invariant with transformation, mager showed that
the partial differential equations for the compressible turbulent
boundary layer can be transformed to incompressible form .  the validity of
this assumption and of the transformations was established for several

theory of stagnation point heat transfer in dissociated
air .
  the boundary-layer equations are developed in general for the
case of very high speed flight where the external flow is in a
dissociated state .  in particular the effects of diffusion and of atom
recombination in the boundary layer are included .  it is shown
that at the stagnation point the equations can be reduced exactly
to a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations even when the
chemical reactions proceed so slowly that the boundary layer is
not in thermochemical equilibrium .
  two methods of numerical solution of these stagnation point
equations are presented, one for the equilibrium case and the
other for the nonequilibrium case .  numerical results are
correlated in terms of the parameters entering the numerical
formulation so as not to depend critically on the physical assumptions
made .
  for the nonequilibrium boundary layer, both catalytic (to
atom recombination) and noncatalytic wall surfaces are
considered .  a solution is represented which shows the transition
from the /frozen/ boundary layer (very slow recombination
rates) to the equilibrium boundary layer (fast recombination rates) .
a recombination rate parameter is introduced to interpret the
nonequilibrium results, and it is shown that a scale factor is
involved in relating the equilibrium state of a boundary layer on
bodies of different sizes .
  it is concluded that the heat transfer through the equilibrium
stagnation point boundary layer can be computed accurately by
a simple correlation formula and that the heat
transfer is almost unaffected by a nonequilibrium state of the
boundary layer provided the wall is catalytic and the lewis
number near unity .

indicate that not only the shock-wave shape but also the surface
pressures for this body are given very closely by the similarity
theory, except near the hemisphere-cylinder junction .
  energy considerations combined with a detailed study of the
equations of motion show that flow similarity is also possible for
a class of bodies of the form, provided that,

body of revolution .  when the shock shape is not
similar to the body shape, and the entire flow field some
distance from the nose must depend to some extent on the details
of the nose geometry .
  by again utilizing energy and drag considerations one finds
that at hypersonic speeds the inviscid surface pressures
generated by a blunt leading edge are larger than the pressures
induced by boundary-layer growth on an insulated flat surface
for an insulated blunt-nosed slender body of revolution the
corresponding distance is given by .  (here

thickness, or nose diameter .)  in free flight these constants are
replaced by 1,700 and 20, respectively, so that viscous
interaction effects are important over the forward portion of a blunt-
nosed slender body only for relatively low values of .
however, /far downstream/ of the nose the inviscid over-pressure is

  the present work is concerned with the determination of
transient temperatures and thermal stresses in simple models intended
to simulate parts or the whole of an aircraft structure of the built-

  the first case considered is that of convective heat transfer
into one side of a flat plate, representing a thick skin, and the
effect of the resulting temperature distribution in inducing
thermal stresses associated with bending restraint at the plate edges .
numerical results are presented for the transient temperature
differentials in the plate when the environment temperature first
increases linearly with time and then remains constant, the
period of linear increase representing the time of acceleration of
the aircraft .  corresponding thermal stress information is
presented .

results are presented for transient temperature differentials for a
wide range of values of the applicable parameters and for an
environment temperature variation as described above .
corresponding thermal stresses in a beam of infinite length are
determined .  a theoretical analysis of the stress distribution in a beam
of finite length is carried out and numerical results obtained for
one case .  an experimental investigation of temperatures and
stresses in such a beam is described, and results are presented

the dynamic motion of a missile descending through

  a method is presented for computing rapidly, yet accurately,
the dynamic motion of a ballistic-type missile descending through
the atmosphere .  the equations of motion are separated into a
set of /static/ trajectory equations (zero angle of attack) and a
set of /rotational/ equations describing the oscillatory motion
of the missile about its center of gravity .  a transformation
allows the rotational equations to be written in a manner
analogous to the equation for an undamped oscillating spring mass
system with the mass equal to unity and a time variable spring
constant .  for given initial conditions this equation can be
solved to obtain the envelope of maximum angle of attack .  an
additional transformation allows the calculation of the complete
oscillatory motion at any time during the trajectory as a function
of the maximum angle of attack at that time .
  this solution shows that the maximum angle of attack of a
missile descending through the atmosphere at relatively constant
speed is reduced even when the aerodynamic damping is neglected .

the prospects for magneto-aerodynamics .
  the equations describing the flow of an electrically conducting
fluid in the presence of electric and magnetic fields are written
down with the aid of certain simplifications appropriate to
aeronautical applications .  in order to estimate the probable
significance of magneto-aerodynamic effects, some data on
conductivity of pure and /seeded/ air are first examined .
dimensionless quantities representing the ratios of forces and of
currents are then formed and their values studied for conditions
of flight in the atmosphere .
  some examples of magneto-hydrodynamic and magneto-
gasdynamic effects in simple flows are given .  these include
two cases of poiscuille flow of conducting liquids with applied
magnetic fields and the case of quasi-one-dimensional gas flow
with applied electrical and magnetic fields .  in the last case,
attractive possibilities are found for controlled acceleration or
deceleration of gas at subsonic and supersonic speeds, even in
constant-area channels .  the behavior of the flow is
characteristically different in different regimes of mach number and flow
speed relative to certain /significant speeds/ that are dependent
on the ratio of electrical to magnetic field strengths .  these
are studied, and a chart is constructed to relate the length to
the speed ratio of a maximum-acceleration constant-area channel .
  it is concluded that the advantages that may accrue from
magneto-aerodynamic methods are sufficiently attractive to
justify the considerable research and engineering development
that will be required .  among the unsolved engineering problems
are the reduction of surface resistance of electrodes in contact
with a conducting gas, development of techniques for seeding,
and provision of the required magnetic fields in flight .

constant-temperature magneto-gasdynamic channel flow .
in the course of investigating boundary-layer flow in
continuous plasma accelerators with crossed electric and
magnetic fields, it was found advantageous to have at hand simple
closed-form solutions for the magneto-gasdynamic flow in the
duct which could serve as free-stream conditions for the boundary
layers .  nontrivial solutions of this sort are not available at
present, and in fact, as in the work of resler and sears, the
variation of conditions along the flow axis must be obtained
through numerical integration .
  consequently, some simple solutions of magneto-gasdynamic
channel flow were sought, possessing sufficient algebraic simplicity
to serve as free-stream boundary conditions for analytic
investigations of the boundary layer in a physically reasonable accelerator .
in particular, since the cooling of the accelerator tube is likely to
be an important physical problem because of the high gas
temperatures required to provide sufficient gaseous conductivity,
channel flow with constant temperature appears interesting .
some simple algebraic solutions for the case of a constant

hence be considered a basis for constructing less restricted

distance and body pressure coefficient are compared with

the newtonian theory of impact has been shown to be
useful for pressure calculations on the forward facing part
of bodies moving at high speed .  it is now a familiar practice
to use this information to calculate nonviscous velocities at the
wall and then to estimate rates of heat transfer .  this
procedure is perhaps open to question,. heat-transfer rates depend
on velocity gradients which are not given by the newtonian
analysis .  nor can one obtain information on boundary-layer
stability or all the body stability derivatives .  it seems,
therefore, inevitable that, as design proceeds with these hypersonic
missiles, there will be a greater need for more accurate
aerodynamic theories either to predict what will happen in unfamiliar
flight conditions or to effect an extrapolation from a known test
result to the design condition .

a new technique for investigating heat transfer and
surface phenomena under hypersonic flow conditions .
on the forebody of many practically interesting hypersonic
vehicles, there is little interaction between the inviscid
flow field and the boundary layer .  therefore, inviscid flow theory
can be used to determine, independent of surface phenomena,
the physically interesting quantities such as shock shape, shock
detachment distance, sonic line shape, and pressure distribution .
furthermore, the pressure distribution so determined can then be
used for the study of heat transfer, materials behavior, and other
surface phenomena .  thus, for these bodies, the prandtl
boundary-layer concept can be utilized for the calculation of both the
inviscid flow and the boundary-layer behavior .
  it is the purpose of this note to point out that this concept can
also be applied experimentally in order to provide, in
conjunction with a conventional hypersonic wind-tunnel air supply, a
means for investigating hypersonic heat transfer and surface
phenomena under conditions of flight reynolds numbers .

  this study of the flow about an airfoil in a near-sonic stream
indicates the important factors determining the pressure
distribution on the airfoil .  analysis of the mach wave pattern
suggests that the supersonic domain of the flow can be derived
from two simple-wave flows, one arising from the mach waves
reflected at the sonic line and the other from the changes in
airfoil surface slope .  the compressive effect of the reflected mach
waves is determined quantitatively as a function of airfoil
leading-edge geometry from an analysis of measured pressure
distributions for uncambered airfoils,. and it is shown how this can
be superimposed on the wave system from the curved surface to
give an equivalent simple-wave flow over the airfoil .
  an application of this scheme to the calculation of the pressure
distribution over an airfoil in a sonic stream gives results in good
agreement with experiment .

transition on a smooth cone can definitely be delayed by surface
cooling, (2) transition promoted by either supply-stream
turbulence or surface roughness can also be delayed by surface cooling
depending upon degree of turbulence or relative roughness
respectively, and (3) the adverse effects of increased turbulence and

  in many wing vibration analyses it is found necessary to take

it is reasonable to ask what vibratory gyroscopic effect this
flexibility may give rise to when propellers are whirling .  an engine
mount may be thought of as a horizontal beam cantilevered
from the wing, having both horizontal and vertical flexibility .
if this beam were infinitely rigid horizontally, then, when it
vibrated, the gyroscopic moments induced in the propeller due
to the resultant pitching motion of its axis would not produce
propeller axis yaw .  however, engine-mount lateral stiffness
tical stiffness, so that gyroscopic effects will play a role as the
propeller axis undergoes pitching vibrations at the tip of the
cantilever engine mount .  the purpose of this paper is to
investigate this role under the assumption that the propeller itself
is a rigid disc .
  the paper is divided into four parts .  part (1) deals briefly
with classical gyroscope theory .  part (2) presents engine
vibration mode studies-experimental photographic techniques on a
model gyroscope mounted at the ends of two different cantilever
beams .  part (3) presents the theory of the coupled motion of
an elastic wing upon which a gyroscope is mounted to simulate
an engine-propeller system on an airplane .  part (4) consists

tip-bluntness effects on cone pressures at m=6.85 .
there is, at present, considerable interest in the
characteristies of blunted bodies from both an aerodynamic and a
heat-transfer standpoint .  the use of blunt shapes is
contemplated to reduce the heat-transfer problem at body noses, but
there are also applications for blunt noses which occur from
mainly aerodynamic considerations .  an actual reduction in
drag may be the beneficial result of blunting the nose of a cone
or a similar slender shape under certain conditions .  although
the sphere has received considerable treatment, the nose shapes
are not necessarily tangent spheres .  in the case, let us say, of a
total head tube situated in the nose of a given body, the blunting
may be quite flat, and nose sections blunter than spherical shape
may conceivably be desirable, in some cases, from the heat-
transfer standpoint .
  the purpose of the present investigation is to examine the
aerodynamic effect of a simple type of nose blunting on a basic
body .
the incompressible flow of an electrically conducting fluid
past a porous plate y = 0 with constant suction velocity in

generalized to take into account the effect of free convection, when a
body force g per unit mass is acting in the negative x-direction
parallel to the wall .  the fluid is assumed to be semi-
incompressible as usual .  in addition to the obvious practical
significance, this problem is also interesting in the sense that it
provides another exact solution of the magnetohydrodynamic
equations, since the only electromagnetic assumptions involved

analysis of low-aspect-ratio aircraft structures .
  two methods are presented for the analysis of complex low-
aspect-ratio aircraft structures .  both methods provide for
arbitrary external loading, are general with respect to the
orientation of structural members, and permit arbitrary boundary
conditions .  for purposes of analysis a structure is idealized as a
network of flexural members with interconnected torsion boxes .
  in the first method, sets of linear equations are obtained by
expressing boundary conditions, member deflection equations,
equilibrium requirements, and slope-compatibility relationships
in terms of deflections and internal forces .  the solution for
deflections and internal forces is then formed as the product of an
inverse structural matrix and a column matrix of load functions .
  in the second method, the conditions at a given boundary are
assembled as a column matrix and are transferred in a step
by-step fashion over the entire structure to an opposite boundary .
the transfer is accomplished by successive multiplications of
square matrices composed independently for the different
transfer ranges .  the final operation is the inversion of a relatively
small matrix and provides the solution for the unknown boundary
conditions .

temperature and velocity profiles in the compressible

  an analysis is presented which enables the temperature
profiles, veiocity profiles, heat transfer, and skin friction to be
calculated for laminar flow over a two-dimensional or axially
symmetric surface without pressure gradient but with an arbitrary
analytic distribution of surface temperature .  the general theory is
applicable to a gas of any prandtl number, although the
numerical results given herein have been computed for air .
the predictions of the theory for the special case of constant
surface temperature are compared with the calculations of crocco .
on the basis of this comparison, it is inferred that the present
theory enables heat-transfer and skin-friction calculations
accurate to within about 5 per cent to be made for flight conditions
up to mach numbers near 5 and to within about 1 or 2 per cent
for supersonic wind-tunnel conditions up to considerably higher
mach numbers .
  a particular effort has been made to present the results, which
are simple considering their generality, in a form that can be used
readily in practical applications .  from the mathematical point
of view, the theory is applicable to an arbitrary analytic
distribution of surface temperature, but in any given practical case it is
necessary that the surface-temperature distribution be
approximated by a polynomial .  the only unknowns in the final
equations developed are the coefficients of this polynomial, so that the
work involved in applying the theory in any given case depends
entirely on the work involved in approximating a given surface-
temperature distribution by a polynomial .
  an example is worked out in detail which illustrates some of the
principal effects of variable surface temperature .  it is shown
that both positively infinite and negatively infinite heat-transfer
coefficients can occur .  the anomaly of infinite and negative
heat-transfer coefficients is discussed and attributed to the
customary definition of the heat-transfer coefficient, which is shown
to be fundamentally inappropriate for flows with variable surface
temperature .  in the particular example considered, a
conventional method for calculating the net heat transferred yields
completely incorrect results .  a brief qualitative discussion of the
possible effects of the heat transfer on flow separation is given .
in order to facilitate the use of the results, all of the principal
equations developed are collected and summarized in the section

procedure for calculating flutter at high supersonic

  a method which may be used at high supersonic mach numbers is
described for calculating the flutter speed of wings having camber in
their deflection modes .  the normal coupled vibration modes of the wing
are used to derive the equations of motion .  chord deflections of the
vibration modes are approximated by polynomials .  the wing may have a
control surface and may carry external stores although no aerodynamic
forces on the stores are presented .  the aerodynamic forces that are
assumed to be acting on the wing are obtained from piston theory and
also from a quasi-steady form of a theory for two-dimensional steady
flow .  airfoil shape and thickness effects are taken account of in the
analysis .
  the method is used to calculate the flutter speed of some wings
which had been previously tested at mach numbers of 1.3 to 3.0 .
comparison of the calculations and experiment is made for flat-plate 60

  experimental research has been conducted on the effects of wall
cooling, mach number, and unit reynolds

number of cylindrical separated boundary
layers on an ogive-cylinder model .
results were obtained from pressure and temperature measurements and
shadowgraph observations .  the maximum
scope of measurements encompassed
mach numbers between 2.06 and 4.24, reynolds numbers (based on length of
separation) between 60,000 and 400,000,
and ratios of wall temperature to
adiabatic wall temperature between 0.35 and 1.0 .
within the range of the
present tests, the transition reynolds number was observed to decrease
with increasing wall cooling, increase with increasing mach number, and
increase with increasing unit reynolds number .  the wall-cooling effect
was found to be four times as great when the attached boundary layer
upstream of separation was cooled in conjunction with cooling of the
separated boundary layer as when only the separated boundary layer was
cooled .  wall cooling of both the
attached and separated flow regions also
caused, in some cases, reattachment in the otherwise separated region .
cavity resonance present in the separated region for some model
configurations was accompanied by a large decrease in transition reynolds
number at the lower test mach numbers .

  the karman-pohlhausen method is extended primarily to sixth-degree
velocity profiles for determining
the characteristics of the compressible
laminar boundary layer over an adiabatic
wall in the presence of an axial
pressure gradient .  it is assumed that the prandtl number is unity and
that the coefficient of viscosity varies linearly with the temperature .
a general approximate solution which permits a rapid determination of

practice lead to results of satisfactory
accuracy, including the critical

the location of the separation point in an adverse pressure gradient, a
short and simple method, based on the use of a seventh-degree velocity
profile, is derived .  the numerical example given here indicates that
this method should in practice lead to sufficiently accurate results .
for the special case of flow near a forward stagnation point it is shown
that the karman-pohlhausen method with the usual fourth-degree profiles

an analysis of the applicability of the hypersonic
similarity law to the study of the flow about bodies

  the hypersonic similarity law as derived by tsien has been
investigated by comparing the pressure distributions along bodies of
revolution at zero angle of attack .  in making
these comparisons, particular
attention was given to determining the limits of mach number and fineness
ratio for which the similarity law applies .  for the purpose of this
investigation, pressure distributions
determined by the method of
characteristics for ogive cylinders for
values of mach numbers and fineness
ratios varying from 1.5 to 12 were compared .
pressures on various cones
and on cone cylinders were also compared in this study .
  the pressure distributions presented demonstrate that the hypersonic
similarity law is applicable over a
wider range of values of mach numbers
and fineness ratios than might be expected from the assumptions made in
the derivation .  this is significant since within the range of
applicability of the law a single pressure
distribution exists for all similarly
shaped bodies for which the ratio of
free-stream mach number to fineness
ratio is constant .  charts are presented

pressure distributions over ogive cylinders for any combination of mach

  the analysis of technical note 2250, 1950, is extended to include
the effects of flow rotation .  it is
found that the theoretical pressure
distributions over ogive cylinders can be related by the hypersonic
similarity rule with sufficient accuracy for most engineering purposes .
  the error introduced into pressure distributions and drag of ogive
cylinders by ignoring the rotation term in the characteristic equations
is investigated .  it is found that
the influence of the rotation term on
pressure distribution and drag depends only upon the similarity
parameter k (mach number divided by fineness ratio) .
although the error in
drag, due to neglect of the rotation term, is negligible at k=0.5, the
error is about 30 percent at k=2.0 .

by combining empirical results

ranges in value from 1 (stagnation-point value) to the negative values
found at the laminar separation points .  three rates of flow through

system are ..  prandtl number of 1.0, linear viscosity-temperature
relation across the boundary layer, an
isothermal surface, and the particular
distributions of free-stream velocity
consistent with similar solutions .
this system admits axial pressure
gradients of arbitrary magnitude, heat
flux normal to the surface, and arbitrary mach numbers .
  the system of differential equations is transformed to an integral
system, with the velocity ratio as
the independent variable .  for this
system, solutions are found for pressure gradients varying from that
causing separation to the infinitely favorable gradient and for wall
temperatures from absolute zero to twice the free-stream stagnation
temperature .  some solutions for separated flows are also presented .
  for favorable pressure gradients, the solutions are unique .  for
adverse pressure gradients, where the solutions are not unique, two
solutions of the infinite family of possible solutions are identified as
essentially viscid at the outer edge of the boundary layer and the
remainder essentially inviscid .  for
the case of favorable pressure gradients
with heated walls, the velocity within
a portion of the boundary layer is
shown to exceed the local external velocity .
the variation of a reynolds
analogy parameter, which indicates the ratio of skin friction to heat
transfer, is from zero to 7.4 for a surface of temperature twice the

the results, which are presented in nondimensional form, indicate that
decreasing the joint conductivity parameter lowers both the interior

ratios in the skin, and may considerably increase the peak stiffener
stress ratios,. increasing the aerodynamic heat-transfer parameter
decreases the interior and average temperature ratios, increases the
peak skin stress ratios somewhat,

stiffener stress ratios,. and increasing the ratio of skin width to skin

which can be solved analytically .
integral (karman-pohlhausen type)
solutions were also obtained to provide

which accurately represent the

the fluid velocity, relative to
the wall, was assumed to have a
seventh-power profile .  the blasius

investigation of the stability of the laminar boundary

  in the present report the stability of two-dimensional laminar
flows of a gas is investigated by the method of small perturbations .
the chief emphasis is placed on the case of the laminar boundary layer .
  part 1 of the present report deals with the general mathematical
theory .  the general equations governing one normal mode of the small
velocity and temperature disturbances are derived and studied in great
detail .  it is found that for reynolds numbers of the order of those
encountered in most aerodynamic problems, the temperature disturbances
have only a negligible effect on those particular velocity solutions
which depend primarily on the viscosity coefficient (/viscous
solutions/) .  indeed, the latter are actually of the same form in the
compressible fluid as in the incompressible fluid, at least to the first
approximation .  because of this fact, the mathematical analysis is
greatly simplified .  the final equation determining the characteristic
values of the stability problem depends on the /inviscid solutions/ and
the function of tietjens in a manner very similar to the case of the
incompressible fluid .  the second viscosity coefficient and the
coefficient of heat conductivity do not enter the problem,. only the
ordinary coefficient of viscosity near the solid surface is involved .
  part 2 deals with the limiting case of infinite reynolds numbers .
the study of energy relations is very much emphasized .  it is shown
that the disturbance will gain energy from the main flow if the gradient
of the product of mean density and mean vorticity near the solid surface
has a sign opposite to that near the outer edge of the boundary layer .
  a general stability criterion has been obtained in terms of the
gradient of the product of density and vorticity, analogous to the
rayleigh-tollmien criterion for the case of an incompressible fluid .
if this gradient vanishes for some value of the velocity ratio of the
main flow exceeding 1-1/m (where m is the free stream mach number) .

analyzed for an idealized propulsion
system which rather closely approaches
present-day rocket motors .
unpowered flight is characterized by a return
to earth along a ballistic, skip,
or glide trajectory .  only those
trajectories are treated which yield the
maximum range for a given velocity at the end of powered flight .
aerodynamic heating is treated in a manner
similar to that employed previously
by the senior authors in studying ballistic missiles (naca tn 4047),
with the exception that radiant as well as convective heat transfer is
considered in connection with glide and skip vehicles .
  the ballistic vehicle is found to be the least efficient of the
several types studied in the sense
that it generally requires the highest
velocity at the end of powered flight in order to attain a given range .
this disadvantage may be offset, however, by reducing convective heat
transfer to the re-entry body through
the artifice of increasing pressure
drag in relation to friction drag - that
is, by using a blunt body .  thus
the kinetic energy required by the vehicle at the end of powered flight
may be reduced by minimizing the mass of coolant material involved .
  the glide vehicle developing lift-drag ratios in the neighborhood
of and greater than 4 is far superior
to the ballistic vehicle in ability
to convert velocity into range .  it has the disadvantage of having far
more heat convected to it,. however, it has the compensating advantage
that this heat can in the main be radiated
back to the atmosphere .
consequently, the mass of coolant material may be kept relatively low .
  the skip vehicle developing lift-drag ratios from about 1 to 4 is
found to be superior to comparable ballistic and glide vehicles in
converting velocity into range .  at
lift-drag ratios below 1 it is found to
be about equal to comparable ballistic
vehicles while at lift-drag ratios

an analytical treatment of aircraft propeller precession
instability .
  an analytical investigation is made of a precession-type instability
which can occur in a flexibly supported aircraft-engine-propeller
combination .  by means of an idealized
mathematical model which is comprised
of a rigid power-plant system flexibly
mounted in pitch and yaw to a fixed
backup structure, the conditions required for neutral stability are
determined .  the paper also examines the sensitivity of the stability
boundaries to changes in such parameters
as stiffness, damping, and
asymmetries in the engine mount, propeller
speed, airspeed, mach number,
propeller thrust, and location of pitch and yaw axes .  stability is found
to depend strongly on the damping and stiffness in the system .
  with the use of nondimensional charts theoretical stability
boundaries are compared with experimental results obtained in wind-tunnel
tests of an aeroelastic airplane model .  in general, the theoretical
results, which do not account for wing response, show the same trends
as observed experimentally,. however,
for a given set of conditions
calculated airspeeds for neutral stability
are consistently lower than the
measured values .  evidently, this result is due to the fact that wing
response tends to add damping to the system .

effects of extreme surface cooling on boundary layer
transition .
  an investigation was made to determine the combined effects of
surface cooling, pressure gradients, nose blunting, and surface finish on
boundary-layer transition .  data were obtained for various body shapes
at a mach number of 3.12 and reynolds
numbers per foot as high as 15x10 .
  previous transition studies, with moderate cooling, have shown
agreement with the predictions of stability theory .  for surface roughnesses
ranging from 4 to 1250 microinches the location of transition was
unaffected with moderate cooling .  with extreme cooling, an adverse effect
was observed for each of the parameters investigated .  in general, the
transition reynolds number decreased with
decreasing surface temperature .
in particular, the beneficial effects of a favorable pressure gradient
obtained with moderate cooling disappear with extreme cooling, and a
transition reynolds number lower than
that observed on a cone is obtained .
further, an increase in the nose bluntness decreased the transition
reynolds number under conditions of extreme cooling .

effect of distributed three-dimensional roughness and

  an investigation was made in the langley 4 by 4-foot supersonic
pressure tunnel at mach numbers of 1.61 and 2.01 to determine (1) the
effect of distributed roughness on boundary-layer transition with the
model surface at adiabatic wall temperature and cooled and (2) the
effect of surface cooling on the lateral spread of turbulence .  both
distributed granular-type and single spherical roughness particles were
used, and transition of the boundary layer was determined by hot-wire
anemometers .  the transition-triggering mechanism of the
three-dimensional roughness at supersonic speeds appeared to be the same as
that previously observed at subsonic speeds .  in fact, the critical
value of the roughness reynolds number parameter (that is,
the value at which turbulent spots are initiated by the roughness) was
found to be approximately the same at supersonic and subsonic speeds
when complete local conditions at the top of the roughness, including
density and viscosity, were considered in the formulation of the
roughness reynolds number .  for three-dimensional roughness at a reynolds
number less than its critical value, the roughness introduced no
disturbances of sufficient magnitude to influence transition .  surface
cooling, although providing a theoretical increase in stability to small
disturbances, did not increase to any important extent the value of the
critical roughness reynolds number for three-dimensional roughness
particles .  cooling, therefore, because of its effect on the
boundary-layer thickness, density, and viscosity actually promoted transition due
to existing three-dimensional surface roughness for given mach and
reynolds numbers .  the measured lateral spread of turbulence in the
boundary layer appeared to be unaffected by the increased laminar
stability derived from the surface cooling .

theoretical investigation of the ablation of a glass-type

at the stagnation point of a re-entering irbm .
  the melting-type heat protection at the stagnation point of a
re-entering irbm is treated by employing homogeneous, opaque, and
nondecomposing glass shields which do not exceed a temperature of
some effects due to variations of the glass properties .  the ballistic
re-entry vehicle has a nose diameter of 0.635 m, a ballistic factor
of 3.5 x 10, a re-entry angle of 124.9 (from the
vertical) at an altitude of 100 km, and a re-entry speed of 4.5 .
the performance of 36 different glass shields with assumed
combinations of material properties is investigated by employing a
calculation method which yields practically exact, transient solutions
for the problem .  as a corollary, results for a certain steady flight
state are also given .  the discussions made it possible to derive
under realistic flight conditions some thermal characteristics for the
employment of thin, or light-weight, glass shields .
  investigation of these hypothetical glass shields leads to the
conclusion that a low thermal conductivity and a high specific heat,
and thus, a small thermal diffusivity are most desirable .  a small
thermal diffusivity yields high surface temperatures, causing a high
radiative heat transfer out of the shield,. and steep temperature
profiles normal to the surface, causing a small thermal penetration across
the shield with little total ablation of the shield .  results show that
for the assumed irbm re-entry, the necessary thickness of the employed
glass shields increases monotonically with thermal diffusivity which is
the only material parameter affecting this thickness .
  a high viscosity level and a high emissivity constant of the
surface of the supposedly opaque shield are also desirable,. although,
these two properties exert a comparatively small influence on the
overall performance when disregarding glass shields with an extremely
low viscosity level .

discussion of solar proton events and manned space
flights .
  as a result of studies made during the
international geophysical year (igy) and the
international geophysical cooperation (igc),
it is known that a considerable fraction of
large solar flares give rise to almost pure
streams of protons which reach the earth and
continue to arrive for as long as 11 days .
the energies of these particles lie within a
very steep spectrum extending from 20 to
least 500 mev .  because of the frequency
of large flares during times of high solar
activity, and owing to the long duration of each
solar proton emission, these particles were
present in detectable intensity near the top
of the earth's atmosphere for about 15 percent
of the time from 1957 to 1960 .  the number
of large flares that accelerated and released
these particles during this three-year period was about 30 .
  the event that began on august 22, 1958
contributed greatly toward the understanding
of the solar and terrestrial sequence of events,
and in addition provided the first
identification of the emitted particles .  a flare on may
of protons in the neighborhood of the earth that
this phenomenon was recognized as an
additional radiation hazard to manned vehicles
in the high atmosphere and in most parts
of the solar system .  the three very intense
events that occurred in july, 1959 further
supported this conclusion, and the possibility
of predicting such events became an
important consideration .  in addition to its value
in the protection of human beings, effective
forecasting clearly would be of great value in
the detailed scientific study of this
phenomenon .
  this paper presents a preliminary
discussion of some aspects of predicting the
arrival of protons at the earth following the
appearance of solar activity features and,
equally important, of forecasting the periods
when this penetrating radiation is unlikely
to occur .

on trails of axisymmetric hypersonic blunt bodies flying

  the trail left in the atmosphere by a body moving at hypersonic
speeds is the subject of theoretical treatment .  the times
required for ionization and dissociation (and their inverse processes)
to go to completion, when compared to the flow times of a gas
particle, are important in determining the observable effects of
hypersonic trails-i.e., emitted thermal radiation and reflection
of electromagnetic waves from the trail .
  in order to simplify the theoretical treatment, the trail is
divided into two regions ..  (1) the expansion-controlled trail,
which treats the behavior of the wake behind the body up to a
point, along the direction of flight, where the pressure decays to
the free-stream value and cooling is controlled principally by the
expansion of the flow, and (2) the conduction-controlled trail,
where the trail cools mainly by diffusion of heat away from the
high-temperature core .
  the influence of the details of the body shape on the
observables are discussed and a simple computational procedure for
the behavior of the conduction-controlled trail is developed based
on integral methods .  results of calculations that assume
thermodynamic equilibrium of the flow field give the values of the
thermodynamic variables in the trail of a sphere, axial
distributions of emitted thermal radiation, and maps of electron density
distribution .  it is shown that the cooling of the
conduction-controlled trail is essentially due to conduction of heat and that
viscous effects are not important .  it is found that this portion
of the trail does not widen as one proceeds downstream .  flight
velocities considered vary between 15,000 and 35,000 ft sec and
altitudes range between 100,000 and 250,000 ft .

an investigation of separated flows, part i: the pressure
field .
  the present article describes an investigation of several types of
separated regions such as blunt-base wakes and cavities formed
in cutouts in the boundaries and ahead of or behind two
dimensional steps in supersonic (mach numbers 2 to 4) and
subsonic flow .  the conditions for the existence, the geometry,
and the pressure field are described in this paper .
  a second article (to be published) will describe investigations of
the internal flow and the heat transfer across such separated
regions .
  it is found that there is a maximum (critical) ratio of the length
of the separated free-shear layer to the depth of the depression
in the boundary beyond which the cavity collapses, leaving
mutually independent separated regions at each protrusion .
this critical length changes greatly upon laminar-turbulent
transition in the oncoming boundary layer,. in either laminar or
turbulent flow it is approximately independent of mach and
reynolds numbers .  a semiempirical correlation predicting the
conditions under which the flow will span a depression of arbitrary
depth is proposed .
  detailed pressure distributions along the boundaries of a
cavity (in turbulent flow) are presented as a function of the ratio
of the cavity length to the critical length, which is found to be
the pertinent similarity parameter .  for short notches
the impact pressure due to the reversal of the inner portion
of the shear layer at recompression tends to thicken the shear
layer and a type of boundary layer-free stream interaction
governs the pressure field .  the pressure in the cavity is nearly
constant and can be higher than free-stream .  in long notches
the shear layer bends inward at separation and
curves back gradually ahead of the recompression point .  the
floor-pressure variation is pronounced and the recovery pressure
at reattachment is small .  the variation of the drag coefficient
with mach number reflects the change from one to the other
mechanism of recompression .
  detailed surveys of the mach-number distributions in a
blunt-body wake and the mixing region behind its throat, as
well as in the shear layer spanning a cutout in a wall, are presented
and analyzed .  it is found that, in general, the assumptions of
the simple supersonic-wake models which rely on a principle of
steady flow with mass conservation in the cavity are not adequate
for cavities in which there is recompression against a boundary .
  results showing the influence of the thickness of the initial
boundary layer (in the range of 0.3 to 3 times the notch depth)
and of the geometry of the notch are also presented .

the transverse curvature effect in compressible axially
symmetric laminar boundary layer flow .
  the viscous transverse curvature effect in compressible axially
symmetric laminar boundary-layer flow has been investigated,
and it is found that the effect is characterized by the parameter
which is essentially the ratio of the boundary-layer thickness
to body radius .  it is shown that the busemann and crocco
integrals of the two-dimensional energy equation for are
still valid for axially symmetric flow in which the transverse
curvature effects are considered .  by a generalization of
mangler's transformation it is then shown that the boundary-layer
equations are reducible to an almost two-dimensional form,
making the analysis simpler for two asymptotic flow regions
characterized by and less than or of the order of unity .
it is with the latter region that the present paper is primarily
concerned, and for this case it is shown that the additional term
in the momentum and energy equations, which differentiates them
from the two-dimensional form, behaves like an external
favorable pressure gradient .
  except for certain special cases it is necessary to obtain the
of the order of unity by means of asymptotic expansions in
ascending powers of a parameter that is small compared to unity
but proportional to .  it is shown how the asymptotic
solutions can be found for (1) the velocity and temperature
distributions for the compressible zero pressure gradient case when the
body shapes are given by and and (2) the
velocity distribution for incompressible flow with an external
velocity of the form past a body given by .  the
zeroth approximation is the mangler result .  for the cases of a
linear external velocity distribution, similar profiles can be found
for all values of .  more generally it is shown that similar
profiles exist if the exponents n and m satisfy the condition that .
here, similar is used in the restricted meaning
that the distributions are derivable from ordinary differential
equations .
  in the case of the cone and cylinder with zero pressure gradient
where the equations have been numerically integrated for,
the first-order correction to the mangler formulation shows that
the effect on both the skin-friction coefficient and heat-transfer
rate can become appreciable in the range where is less than
or of the order of unity .  at a constant, the effects are
increased in magnitude when either the ratio of wall to free-stream
temperature, or mach number, is increased .  also, all other
conditions being equal, for the same value of the skin-friction
coefficient and heat-transfer increase on the cylinder is greater
than that on the cone .
  for flows with pressure gradient, the transverse curvature term
behaves again like a favorable pressure gradient and tends to
delay both separation and transition when compared with axially
symmetric flows in which the transverse curvature effect is
neglected .

review of published data on the effect of roughness on transition from

a review is presented of the published data on the effect of roughness,
especially single roughness elements, on transition from laminar to
turbulent flow, in which an attempt is made to reanalyze and correlate the
available information .  the reanalysis shows that the transition
reynolds number of a flat plate with zero pressure gradient is a
function of the ratio of the height of the roughness element to the
displacement thickness of the boundary layer at the element, this functional
relation being a better representation of the data than a constant
critical reynolds number of the roughness element .  other data show that the
effects of roghness are similar in streams of different initial
turbulence and that a plot of the ratio of transition reynolds number of the
rough plate to that for the smooth plate against the ratio of the height
of the roughness element to displacement thickness of the boundary layer
at the element gives good correlation of all the data for a given shape
when transition occurs downstream from the
roughness element .  at a certain value of the height-thickness ratio
dependent on the stream speed, location of roughness element, and
airstream turbulence, the transition position reaches the element and
remains there as the height or the stream speed is further increased .
the paper also discusses available data on the effect of distributed
roughness on transition on a flat plate, as well as some of the
published data on roughness effects on transition on air-foils .

a mixing theory for the interaction between dissipative

  by means of a simplified theoretical /model,/ the present paper
treats the general class of flow problems characterized by the
interaction between a viscous or dissipative flow near the surface
of a solid body, or in its wake, and an /outer/ nearly isentropic
stream .  for the present, the external flow is taken to be a plane,
steady, supersonic flow, which makes a small angle with a plane
surface or plane of symmetry, although the methods used can be
extended to curved surfaces, to axially symmetric supersonic
flows, and also to subsonic flows .  the internal dissipative flow
is regarded as quasi-one-dimensional and parallel to the surface
on the average, with a properly defined mean velocity and mean
temperature .  the nonuniformity of the actual velocity
distribution is taken into account only approximately by means of a
relation between mean temperature and mean velocity .
mixing, or the transport of momentum from outer stream to
dissipative flow, is considered to be the fundamental physical process
determining the pressure rise that can be supported by the flow .
with the aid of this concept, a large number of flow problems is
shown to be basically similar, such as boundary-layer
shockwave interaction, wake flow behind blunt-based bodies (base
pressure problem), flow separation in overexpanded supersonic
nozzles, separation on wings and bodies, etc .

the fundamentals of the statistical theory of turbulence .
statistical theory in general considers mean values of certain
quantities .  in the case of the turbulent motion one is interested in mean
values of velocities and of their derivatives, and in mean values of
squares and products of velocities and their derivatives .  it was o.
reynolds who first expressed the so-called apparent or turbulent
stresses by the mean values of the products of the velocity components .  the
different theories suggested so far have as their common objective the
establishment of relations between certain mean values, e.g. between the
turbulent shear stresses given by the mean products of velocity
fluctuations and the derivatives of the mean velocities, i.e. the measured mean
velocity gradients .  in this sort of investigations the conception of
the /correlation/ is of paramount importance .  the late a. friedman
tried to introduce the correlations as unknown variables in the
hydrodynamic equations., however, he could not carry his investigations to
practical results, i.e., to results which can be compared with the
experimental evidence .  recently, g. i. taylor had success in his
analysis of /isotropic/ turbulence by means of correlation calculations, and
was able to discuss, theoretically, the problem of the decay of
turbulence in a windstream behind a turbulence producing device .  his theory
raised considerable interest because it is concerned with the important
problem of wind-tunnel turbulence and its results could be compared
directly with experimental work done by dryden in this country and by
fage, townend and simmons in england .
the present paper is concerned with two fundamental problems.. with
uniform isotropic turbulence and with the turbulent friction in a
parallel stream .  first, the general theory of isotropic turbulence is
developed .  this general theory includes taylor's consideration as a
special case .  however, it

vibration isolation of aircraft power plants .
vibration in aircraft structure can almost
always be traced to vibratory forces originating
from the power plant .  these forces are transmitted
to the aircraft in two ways ..  (1) by the action of air
forces upon the surfaces of the aircraft in, or adjacent
to, the slip stream of the propeller, and (2) by direct
transmission of unbalanced forces from the power
plant through the engine mounting .  the latter has
always caused the preponderance of disturbance .
vibratory stresses induced in the engine mounting
structure occasionally produce fatigue failures in the
associated parts, and always shorten the useful life
of the entire aircraft structure .  more important,
however, are the psychological and physiological
effects of continuous vibration and its attendant noise
on the passengers and crew .  this may very likely
be the major source of the rapid fatigue which is so
intimately associated with flying .  the importance
and desirability of drastically reducing vibration can
hardly be questioned .
  this paper is limited to a consideration of the
directly transmitted forces and, further, considers the
power plants as rigid bodies attached by flexible means
to the aircraft which is also considered as a rigid body
of relatively large mass .  it is also limited to the case
of engines and engine supporting structures having
axial symmetry (radial engines), although the methods
employed could easily be extended to other cases .

laminar heat transfer over blunt-nosed bodies at hypersonic flight
speeds .
this paper deals with two limiting cases of laminar heat transfer over
blunt-nosed bodies at hypersonic flight speeds, or high stagnation
temperatures..  (a) thermodynamic equilibrium, in which the chemical
reaction rates are regarded as /very fast/ compared to the rates of diffusion
across streamlines., (b) diffusion as rate-governing, in which the
volume recombination rates within the boundary layer are /very slow/
compared to diffusion across streamlines .  in either case the gas density
near the surface of a blunt-nosed body is much higher than the density
just outside the boundary layer, and the velocity and stagnation
enthalpy profiles are much less sensitive to pressure gradient than in the
more familiar case of moderate temperature differences .  in fact, in
case (a), the nondimensionalized enthalpy gradient at the surface is
represented very accurately by the /classical/ zero pressure gradient
value, and the surface heat-transfer rate distribution is obtained
directly in terms of the surface pressure distribution .  in order to
illustrate the method, this solution is applied to the special cases
of an unyawed hemisphere and an unyawed, blunt cone capped by a
spherical segment .
in the opposite limiting case where diffusion is rate-controlling the
diffusion equation for each species is reduced to the same form as the
low-speed energy equation, except that the prandtl number is replaced
by the schmidt number .  the simplifications introduced in case (a) are
also applicable here, and the expression for surface heat transfer rate
is similar., the maximum value of the ratio between the rate of heat
transfer by diffusion alone and by heat conduction alone in the case of
thermodynamic equilibrium is given by..  (prandtl no./schmidt no .)
when the diffusion coefficient is estimated by taking a reasonable value
of atom-molecule collision cross section this ratio is 1.30 .
additional theoretical and (especially) experimental studies are clearly
required before these simple results are accepted .

transversely to the fluid motion and is assumed to remain constant

the production of uniform shear flow in a wind tunnel .
  a nearly uniform shear flow was obtained in the working
section of a wind tunnel by inserting a grid of parallel rods with
varying spacing .
  the function of such a grid is to impose a resistance to the
flow, so graded across the working section as to produce a linear
variation in the total pressure at large distances downstream
without introducing an appreciable gradient in static pressure near
the grid .  a method of calculating a suitable arrangement of the
rods is described .  although this method is strictly applicable
only to weakly sheared flows, an experiment made with a grid
designed for a shear parameter as large as 0.45 gave results in
close agreement with the theory .  there was no evidence from
the experiment of any large-scale secondary flow accompanying
the shear--a danger inherent in an empirical attempt to grade the
resistance of the grid--nor was any tendency observed for the
shear to decay with increasing distance from the grid .

dynamics of a dissociating gas .
  this is a lucid introduction to the effects of dissociation
in gas dynamics .  the problem in view is that of air flow
past a bluff body at speeds somewhat above 2 km sec .
thermodynamic equilibrium is assumed,. theories of near
equilibrium for transport properties and of large
departures from equilibrium being promised in parts 2 and 3 .
  following a survey of the equilibrium statistical
thermodynamics of a pure dissociating diatomic gas, a
new model is introduced .  this /ideal dissociating gas/ is
characterized by only three constants, the characteristic
temperature, density and internal energy for dissociation .
physically, it may be regarded as having its vibrational
modes always just half excited (so that at low
temperatures the ratio of specific heats approaches 4 3 rather
then 7 5) .  thermodynamic properties of the ideal gas
are derived, and the oblique shock wave relations
deduced in the /strong-shock/ approximation (including an
elegant relation between the principal curvatures of any
bow shock and the subsequent vorticity) .  useful relations
are given for the isentropic changes that take place along
streamlines between shocks .
  various of these results are applied to the problem
typified by a sphere flying at high mach number .  the
newtonian impact theory and its empirical modification
are dismissed as lacking theoretical basis, in favor of the
limit for large values of both mach number and density
ratio across the shock .  it is suggested that the zero
surface pressure sometimes predicted by the latter theory
corresponds to separation not of the flow but of the shock
wave from the surface .  an estimate is given for the
subsequent shape of the shock .  finally, another
approximation is applied to the region near the stagnation
streamline .  the fluid is assumed incompressible, but rotational
in accord with the shock relations,. and it is shown that a
spherical shock corresponds to a concentric spherical body .
the resulting surface pressure is within 1 per cent of that
predicted by freeman's second approximation based on
the newtonian-plus-centrifugal solution (same j. 1 (1956),

found to degenerate into a core of uniform flow
surrounded by boundary layers on each wall .
the layers on the walls parallel to the imposed

field is given .  the pressure correlation of the random
field is assumed to have a scale small compared to
the plate size, to decay exponentially, and to convect
with constant speed over the plate .  two cases are
considered, one in which the convection speed is much
less than the speed of free flexural waves in the plate,
the other in which the convection speed is the same
order as the flexural wave speed .  the mean square plate
displacement is shown to be relatively independent
of convection for speeds much less than the flexural
wave speed, and to increase significantly for speeds in
the order of the flexural wave speed .  it is shown that
damping is usually, but not always, an effective means
of vibration reduction .  in the case of convection
speeds much smaller than the flexural speed, the use of
hysteretic damping for reduction of the displacement
response is shown to be limited by the decay of the
assumed random pressure field .

the paper concerns the hydrodynamic turbulent

the approximations currently used in
lubrication problems, owing to the lubricant film
thickness, the general motion equations for
turbulent lubrication are written .
  using the prandtl mixing length hypothesis,
exact and approximate solutions are
obtained for the velocity distribution into the
lubricant layer .  the results are discussed by
pointing out the pressure gradient and the
reynolds number influence on the velocity
distributions, as well as the differences with
respect to the laminar flow .
  in order to obtain simple formulae, the
exact dependence of the rate of flow on the
pressure gradient into a dimensionless form
is replaced by a linear relation, the slope of
which depends on the reynolds number .
this approximation allows the obtainment of
the pressure differential equation under a
simple form .  the pressure equation is integrated

a region of higher velocity, this displacement increasing
the main stream, (2) as the stream becomes progressively
non-uniform, (3) with increase of minor axis length when
the major axis length remains invariant .  in each case the
displacement reaches a limiting value as the cylinder moves away
from the axis of symmetry of the stream .  these limiting
values are reached at critical distances from the axis of symmetry,
which decrease as the stream becomes progressively non-uniform,
but these distances are approximately independent of incidence .

a simplified approximate method for the calculation of the pressure
around conical bodies of arbitrary shape in supersonic and hypersonic

exact conical-flow solutions are available only for circular cones at

quite complicated and further limited to certain body shapes or certain
mach-number ranges .  a great need was therefore felt for a simple
approximate method applicable to any arbitrarily shaped conical body at
zero incidence as well as at angle of attack .
such a method has been developed recently at lockheed and is presented
here in abbreviated form .  the method is based on the /equivalent-cone/
theory .  this theory determines the pressure on a conical body
utilizing information for a symmetric cone at zero angle of attack with the
same normal component of the free stream with respect to the surface as
the local element of the body considered .  this method works relatively
well at high mach numbers .  however, it is quite inconsistent at lower
mach numbers, especially for bodies which deviate considerably from
circular cones .  the equivalent-cone method does not give satisfactory
results, mainly due to the fact that it considers only the local surface
element on the body independent of the other body elements in the
newtonian-theory manner .

experimental and theoretical means .  two gaseous coolants, nitrogen

half angle of 30 .  the effect of the mass transfer on the shock
shape, pressure distribution, heat transfer, and transition are
investigated .  the experimental work involved tests in the
mach-number-8.0 tunnel at pibal .  the theoretical analysis involved
a study of the effect of mass transfer on the shock stand-off
distance and leads to an inviscid-flow parameter permitting the
experimentally determined shock shape and pressure distribution
to be extrapolated to other than test conditions and to other
coolant gases .  there is obtained the maximum value of this
parameter resulting in no significant alteration of the pressure
distribution on the cone and thus defining the flows in which
boundary-layer-type similarity applies .
  significant reductions in heat transfer are obtained with
injection .  indeed, with small amounts of helium injection the
peak heating is found to occur downstream on the cone and to be
an order of magnitude less than would occur at the stagnation
point without mass transfer .  with nitrogen early transition is
found to occur, so that local heating rates are actually increased
over those prevailing at the same reynolds number without

basis for the comparison .  most of the approximate theories
are inadequate except over very limited ranges of fineness ratio
and mach number .  the combination of second-order
supersonic theory and second-order shock-expansion theory provides
consistently good results throughout the supersonic speed range .
  on the basis of exact (or nearly exact) supersonic solutions and
a limited amount of test data and theory in the transonic region,
summary design curves are developed that give the pressure
drag of conical and ogive noses and conical and ogive boattails
over the complete range of transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic
mach numbers .  other shapes can be analyzed in the same
manner, provided that an equivalent amount of data is available .
  the analysis is made with the assumption of inviscid flow,
so that the effects of boundary-layer growth, shock

through the porous wall .  substantial reductions in skin
friction are realized with gas injection within the range of mach
numbers of this test .  the relative reduction in skin friction is
in accordance with theory--that is, the light gases are most
effective when compared on a mass flow basis .  there is a marked
effect of mach number on the reduction of average skin friction,.
this effect is not shown by the available theories .  limited
transition location measurements indicate that the boundary layer
does not fully trip with gas injection but that the transition point
approaches a forward limit with increasing injection .  the
variation of the skin-friction coefficient, for the lower injection rates
with natural transition, is dependent on the flow reynolds
number and type of injected gas,. and at the high injection rates the
skin friction is in fair agreement with the turbulent
boundary-layer results .

in this frequency range .   the mean mach number at the pipe orifice was
varied from 0.3 to 1.0 .
the dependence of the apparent position of the noise sources on

situated farther from the jet orifice the higher the jet speed .  lower
frequency sources appear farther downstream than ones of higher

of constant sound intensity .  these sound fields are analyzed in terms
of the moving quadrupole sources of lighthill's theory and good

predominantly that of three mutually orthogonal longitudinal quadrupoles
which, except for the effect of convection upon it, has a sound field

two-dimensional jet mixing of a compressible fluid .
  the mixing and divergence of a supersonic jet exhausting into
a supersonic stream are investigated theoretically .
  in the first part of this paper, the flow is assumed to be laminar .
when the velocity and temperature in the jet are different
slightly from those of the surrounding stream, by the method of
small perturbations and under ordinary boundary layer
assumptions, the equation of motion of two-dimensional flow will be
reduced to a form of the well-known equation of heat conduction,
whose solution is known for any given boundary conditions .  it
has also been shown that the exact solution of the two
dimensional jet mixing of viscous compressible fluids can be obtained
by successive approximations starting with the solution of small
perturbations .
  velocity and temperature distributions for two cases--one is
the mixing of two-uniform flows and the other is the mixing of a
jet of compressible fluid from a two-dimensional nozzle with full
expansion exhausting into a supersonic stream--have been
calculated .  the properties of the jet mixing depend mainly on the
momentum of the jet regardless of whether the change of
momentum is due to the change of velocity or the change of
temperature--i.e., the change of density .  compressibility has a
considerable effect on the properties of the jet .
  in the second part, the cases of turbulent flow are investigated .
by means of reichardt's theory of free turbulence, the turbulent
shearing stress may be expressed as
  it has been shown in this paper that
where is a constant that can be determined experimentally .
the value of n lies between 0 and 1 .  the exact value of n
depends on the condition of mixing .
  when the expression of turbulent shearing stress given above
is used instead of the viscous stress in the equation of motion,
by suitable transformation of variables, it has been shown that
the equation of two-dimensional turbulent jet mixing is identical
to that of the laminar case .  hence, the solution of the first part
of this paper can be applied to the turbulent case, provided that
the characteristic constants and n have been properly chosen .

determination of the structure of shock waves was first appreciated clearly
by sir geoffrey taylor .  as an essential introduction to the main
topics, author gives an exceptionally clear and valuable account
of the physical mechanisms of viscosity, thermal conductivity, and
other diffusion effects, including relaxation .  the classical theory
of shock-wave formation is then discussed, and some extensions
are made .
  the remainder of the article is based on the demonstration that
the nonlinear equation for plane progressive sound waves, in which
convection and diffusion are taken into account to a first
approximation, can be transformed into burgers's equation, the general
solution of which was given by hopf and cole .  this approach, in
which all flows are continuous (they become discontinuous at
shock waves in the limit as viscosity, etc., tend to zero), allows
the author to re-derive and extend whitham's theory of the
formation and decay of weak plane shock waves, and to derive many
new results, such as the velocity distributions during the union
of two shock waves and during the formation of a shock wave .
the application of the same idea to non-plane shock waves is
also discussed, but more briefly,. in these cases, burgers's
equation is not quite such a good approximation as before .
  the article concludes with sections on sound waves whose
reynolds numbers based on the length scale of the flow and the
velocity amplitude are comparable with unity, and on the effects
of relaxation on the properties of shock waves .  the whole is
much more than a survey, and represents a very substantial
advance in the theory of sound waves .  it is the finest possible

some effects of surface curvature on laminar boundary

  the laminar flow of a viscous incompressible fluid over a
two-dimensional curved surface is investigated for two cases, one in
which the curvature is /large/ and the other in which it is
cases are obtained as approximations from the exact equations of
motion by an order-of-magnitude analysis .  these equations are
solved for flow over a particular surface with zero surface pressure
gradient .  in this analysis, the pressure gradient normal to the
surface is included, and the outer boundary conditions are
modified in accordance with the requirements of flow over a curved
surface .
  the results indicate that for equal reynolds numbers, the
stress on convex surfaces is less than the flat-plate value, while
the stress on concave surfaces is greater than for a flat plate .  the
most important effect of surface curvature, for the cases
considered, is the modification of the shape of the velocity profile
near the /outer edge/ of the boundary layer .  the requirement
that a smooth transition exist between the viscous flow and the
potential flow at the outer edge of the layer causes the profile to
have a negative slope near the outer edge for convex surface
curvature and a positive slope for concave surface curvature .

note on an interaction between the boundary layer and the inviscid
flow .
according to the classical boundary-layer theory the flow about bodies
at reynolds numbers of aeronautical interest can be considered as
composed of two regimes..  an outside inviscid flow and a thin
boundary-layer region adjacent to the body .  this point of view leads to the
approximation that, on a slightly curved surface, throughout the layer
is negligibly small .  the additional assumption that the inviscid flow
is irrotational leads to the requirement that is zero at the outer edge
of the boundary layer .  in this theory any interaction between the two
regimes is accountable by a simple correction to the body shape based on
the boundary-layer displacement thickness .
recently, in connection with hypersonic laminar boundary layers, this
classical point of view has been modified., an interaction between the
two flow regimes leading to a self-induced axial pressure gradient has
been considered .  it is the purpose of the present note to point out
another type of interaction which may be of practical importance and of
fundamental interest even at mach numbers below those considered in the
hypersonic boundary-layer theory and which may have to be considered in
that theory .

the calculation of wall shearing stress from heat-transfer measurements

it has been shown by ludwieg that the wall shearing stress of a laminar

from a heat-transfer measurement at the surface .  the instrument
used in that investigation was essentially a small, locally insulated,
heating element embedded in the test surface .  the size of the
instrument was restricted by the condition that the thermal boundary layer
generated by the heating element be contained locally within the laminar
sublayer .  in the present analysis ludweig's theory for such an
instrument is extended to compressible flow over an insulated flat plate .
with the same limitations on the design and operation of the instrument
as mentioned above, it can also be assumed for compressible laminar
and turbulent boundary layers that only the flow in the immediate
vicinity of the wall or the laminar sublayer will be affected in the region
of the heated element .  this assumption then permits the use of the
laminar boundary-layer equations as the governing equations for this
analysis for both laminar and turbulent boundary layers .

wakes in axial compressors .
the tendency in the past has been to assume that
when wakes or non-uniform total head profiles are
fed into an axial compressor then substantially constant
static pressure prevails at the entry, the variations in total
head appearing as variations in velocity .  this variation
in velocity causes variation in incidence on the early stage
blade rows and thus can give rise to excitation of blade
vibration .  this assumption is implicit, for instance, in
references 1 and 2, but we think has been a common
assumption by most of the people working in this field .
  where the compressor is fed by a duct of substantially
parallel walls for a reasonable length ahead, such an
assumption appeared justifiable .  such a duct when given
an air flow test with its outlet discharging, for instance,
to atmosphere instead of to the compressor, then the
distribution assumed would normally be obtained and in fact
many surveys of such ducts have been represented in this
fashion .  the object of this note is to show that, in fact,
this distribution will not normally occur when the
compressor is present and we may normally expect much more
nearly a constant velocity into the compressor with
attendant static pressure distributions to match with the total
head variations ahead of the intake, with of course, the
attendant curved flow to support the static pressure
gradients .

the determination of turbulent skin friction by means
of pitot tubes .
  a simple method of determining
local turbulent skin friction on a smooth
surface has been developed which utilises a
round pitot tube resting on the surface .
assuming the existence of a region near the
surface in which conditions are functions
only of the skin friction, the relevant physical
constants of the fluid and a suitable length,
a universal non-dimensional relation is
obtained for the difference between the total
pressure recorded by the tube and the static
pressure at the wall, in terms of the skin
friction .  this relation, on this assumption,
is independent of the pressure gradient .
the truth and form of the relation were first
established, to a considerable degree of
accuracy, in a pipe using four geometrically
similar round pitot tubes--the diameter
being taken as representative length .  these four
pitot tubes were then used to determine
the local skin friction coefficient at three stations
on a wind tunnel wall, under varying
conditions of pressure gradient .  at each station,
within the limits of experimental
accuracy, the deduced skin friction coefficient was
found to be the same for each pitot
tube, thus confirming the basic assumption and
leaving little doubt as to the correctness
of the skin friction so found .  pitot traverses
were then made in the pipe and in the
boundary layer on the wind tunnel wall .  the results
were plotted in two non-dimensional
forms on the basis already suggested and they
fell close together in a region whose
outer limit represented the breakdown of the
basic assumption, but close to the wall
the results spread out, due to the unknown
displacement of the effective centre of a
pitot tube near a wall .  this again provides
further evidence of the existence of a
region of local dynamical similarity and of the
correctness of the skin friction deduced
from measurements with round pitot tubes on
the wind tunnel wall .  the extent of the
region in which the local dynamical similarity
may be expected to hold appears to vary
from about to of the boundary-layer
thickness for conditions remote from,
and close to, separation respectively .

supersonic flow past slender bodies with discontinuous
profile slope .
  ward's slender-body theory is extended to derive first
approximations to the external forces on slender
bodies of general cross section
with discontinuous profile slope .  two
classes of body are considered ..
bodies whose profile (typified by the local
radius) is continuous between the
nose and base, and certain bodies whose
profile is discontinuous, such as
bodies with annular or side air intakes and
wing-bodies on which the wing
has an unswept leading edge .  (where air
intakes are concerned, it is
assumed that they are sharp-edged and that
there is no /spillage/ of the
internal flow) .
  the following conclusions apply to
the former class of bodies .  the
variation of drag with mach number is
found to depend only on the
discontinuities in the longitudinal rate of change
of the cross-sectional area, and is
thus independent of cross-sectional shape .
the drag itself is unchanged if
the direction of the flow is reversed .  the
expressions for lift and moment
assume the same forms as for smooth pointed
bodies, the lift depending only
on conditions at the base of the body .
  the general theory is applied to
winged bodies of revolution with an
unswept wing leading edge ..  the results
bear a marked resemblance to those
obtained by ward .  the results for wings
alone are seen to be applicable,
with one modification, to subsonic as well as to supersonic speeds .

distributions which are unlikely to be
seriously affected by viscous effects .

thickness in three-dimensional flow may be written
if, as orthogonal coordinates (x,y) specifying position on the
surface, we choose x as the velocity potential of the external
flow, and y as a coordinate, constant along the external-flow
streamlines, such that h dy is the distance between (x,y) and
z is the distance from the surface, u and v are the x and y components

expansions at small reynolds number for the flow past

  this paper is concerned with the problem of obtaining higher
approximations to the flow past a sphere and a circular cylinder
than those represented by the well-known solutions of stokes
and oseen .  since the perturbation theory arising from the
consideration of small non-zero reynolds numbers is a singular
one, the problem is largely that of devising suitable techniques for
taking this singularity into account when expanding the solution
for small reynolds numbers .
  the technique adopted is as follows .  separate, locally valid
the regions close to, and far from, the obstacle .  reasons are
presented for believing that these 'stokes' and 'oseen' expansions
are, respectively, of the forms
where are spherical or cylindrical polar coordinates made
dimensionless with the radius of the obstacle, r is the reynolds
number, and and vanish with r .  substitution
of these expansions in the navier-stokes equation then yields a
set of differential equations for the coefficients and, but
only one set of physical boundary conditions is applicable to each
expansion (the no-slip conditions for the stokes expansion, and
the uniform-stream condition for the oseen expansion) so that
unique solutions cannot be derived immediately .  however, the
fact that the two expansions are (in principle) both derived from
the same exact solution leads to a 'matching' procedure which
yields further boundary conditions for each expansion .  it is thus
possible to determine alternately successive terms in each
expansion .
  the leading terms of the expansions are shown to be closely
related to the original solutions of stokes and oseen, and detailed
results for some further terms are obtained .

and skan's equation .  the results obtained
are very striking,. few terms in the expansions
are sufficient to obtain close agreement with
hartree's laborious numerical computations .
  the method is also applied to the general
boundary-layer equation for the case of flow past
an elliptic cylinder, measured by schubauer .
the results obtained are in close agreement
with schubauer's measurements for the velocities,
almost up to separation, for the position of
the separation point,. and in satisfactory agreement downstream of
separation .
