correlation between maternal and fetal plasma levels of glucose and free
fatty acids .                                                           
  correlation coefficients have been determined between the levels of   
glucose and ffa in maternal and fetal plasma collected at delivery .    
significant correlations were obtained between the maternal and fetal   
glucose levels and the maternal and fetal ffa levels . from the size of 
the correlation coefficients and the slopes of regression lines it      
appears that the fetal plasma glucose level at delivery is very strongly
dependent upon the maternal level whereas the fetal ffa level at        
delivery is only slightly dependent upon the maternal level .

changes of the nucleic acid and phospholipid levels of the livers in the
course of fetal and postnatal development .                             
  we have followed the evolution of dna, rna and pl in the livers of rat
foeti removed between the fifteenth and the twenty-first day of         
gestation and of young rats newly-born or at weaning . we can observe   
the following facts..                                                   
  1. dna concentration is 1100 ug p on the 15th day, it decreases from  
the 19th day until it reaches a value of 280 ug 5 days after weaning .  
  2. rna concentration is 1400 ug p on the 15th day and decreases to 820
during the same period .                                                
  3. pl concentration is low on the 15th day and during foetal life (700
ug) and increases abruptly at birth .                                   
  4. the ratios rna cyto/dna and pl cyto/dna increase regularly from the
18th day of foetal life .                                               
  5. nuclear rna and pl contents are very high throughout the           
development .                                                           
  6. these results enable us to characterize three stages in the        
development of the rat liver.. - from the 15th day to the 18th day of   
foetal life.. stage of growth through hyperplasia without hypertrophy,  
  - from the 19th day of foetal life to the 3rd day of post-natal life,.
stage of cellular reorganisation,                                       
  - after the 3rd day of post-natal life.. stage of growth through      
hyperplasia and hypertrophy .

surfactant in fetal lamb tracheal fluid .                               
  lambs delivered by cesarean section with intact fetal circulation have
a fluid filling the trachea . analysis revealed that this fluid         
contained material high in surface activity in lambs delivered near     
term, but less surface activity in premature lambs .                    
  administration of 10 per cent oxygen to the ewe for 1 hour prior to   
delivery did not alter the surfactant properties of the fetal tracheal  
fluid .                                                                 
  two analyses of the fetal tracheal fluid revealed it to contain 146   
and 198 mg. of lipid per 100 ml., 30 to 40 per cent of which was        
phospholipid, part of the active component of surfactant .              
  the investigations reported here offer a model for further research   
into possible intrauterine factors in the pathogenesis of hyaline       
membrane disease .

placental and cord blood lipids.. comparison in a set of double ovum    
twins, a stillborn and a live-born .                                    
  1. determinations of phospholipid, total and free cholesterol,        
triglyceride and nefa have been made on placental tissue and cord blood 
in a set of double ovum twins, one stillborn and one live-born .        
  2. similarities occurred in all fractions studied except the cord     
blood triglyceride and nefa levels .                                    
  3. the serum of the stillborn infant contained one-third as much      
triglyceride and 21/2 times as much nefa as did the live-born infant .  
  4. the phospholipid content and the total lipid content of the        
stillbirth placenta were the highest studied in this laboratory which   
includes determinations on 26 live births .                             
  5. the suggestion is made that increased lipoprotein lipase activity  
in the cord blood may accompany intrauterine fetal death .

free fatty acid concentration in maternal plasma and fetal body fat     
content .                                                               
  subcutaneous injection of 200 u.s.p. units of heparin into female     
sprague-dawley rats produced large and sustained elevations of plasma   
free fatty acids but no significant change in blood glucose . a group of
pregnant rats received such injections of heparin 3 times daily         
throughout pregnancy . the fetuses from mothers of this group, at 191/2 
and 211/2 days of gestation, had significantly more body fat than the   
fetuses from uninjected mothers . the hypothesis is presented that the  
maternal free fatty acid concentration in part determines fetal fat     
accumulation . it is proposed that the body composition changes noted in
babies of mothers with diabetes might thus be ascribed to abnormally    
high maternal plasma free fatty acid concentrations .

the concentration of non-esterified fatty acids in maternal and fetal   
plasma in intact, alloxan-diabetic and x-ray-irradiated rats .          
  determinations of the non-esterified fatty acids in the plasma of     
pregnant rats showed that there do not exist any increases in the       
concentrations depending on pregnancy during the period from the 20th - 
22nd day of pregnancy . in the fetal plasma the concentrations of       
non-esterified fatty acids only amounted to 40 - 50 per cent of the     
maternal values .                                                       
  with alloxan diabetes produced 2 days prior to the test the           
concentration in the maternal plasma increased three- to fivefold, while
at the same time a significant rise was absent in fetal plasma with     
slightly increased average values .                                     
  whole-body x-ray exposures (dose.. 400r, dose output.. 40r/min) of    
non-pregnant female and of pregnant rats beginning on the 17th day of   
pregnancy did not result in any changes of the concentration of         
non-esterified fatty acids immediately after irradiation .

lipid metabolism in toxemia and normal pregnancy .                      
  the amount and fatty acid composition of total lipid extract from     
serum were examined in normal pregnant women in the first, second, and  
third trimesters, and early postpartum period, and in patients with mild
and severe preeclampsia and with essential hypertension . placentas at  
term were also examined for total lipid and its fatty acid composition .
in the normal women, total serum lipid increased during pregnancy . the 
rise was less pronounced in those with preeclampsia or hypertension .   
serum palmitate was mildly but significantly elevated in preeclampsia . 
total lipid and arachidonic acid were elevated in the placentas of      
preeclamptic women . the findings are compared with those obtained from 
animals developing eclampsia on an experimental basis .

essential fatty acids and acids with trans-configuration in the         
subcutaneous and visceral fat of the newborn .                          
  we made an investigation of the subcutaneous and visceral fat in the  
newborn . we estimated the contents of linolic and linolenic acid and of
acids with trans-configuration spectrophotometrically .                 
  we were able to show the penetration of these acids through the       
placental barrier . the essential fatty acid contents of fat in the     
newborn is low . in immature ones about 7-14 g, there is a rising trend.

acetoacetate formation by livers from human fetuses aged 8-17 weeks .   
  slices and homogenates from livers of human fetuses aged 8-17 weeks   
have a low rate of acetoacetate formation which can be raised by        
addition of acetate or octanoate to the incubation medium . it was not  
possible to demonstrate acetoacetate formation by isolated liver        
mitochondria from 17-week-old fetuses, probably because mitochondria are
injured during isolation .

changes in blood glucose and non-esterified fatty acids in the foetal

  changes in blood glucose and non-esterified fatty acids after         
intravenous adrenaline were measured in foetal, newborn and adult sheep 
in the foetus and immediately after birth there was very little       
increase in either blood glucose or non-esterified fatty acids after    
adrenaline . the response of blood glucose to adrenaline had reached    
adult levels at twenty-four hours of age . the response of non-esterifi-
ed fatty acids to adrenaline increased gradually over the first week .

electron-microscopic observatations on transference of fat through the  
human placenta .                                                        
  from the results of our previous and present studied on the           
transportation of fat through the human placenta by means of electron   
microscopy, we obtained the following conclusions .                     
  1) neutral fat can permeate through the human placenta without        
dissociation .                                                          
  2) almost all processes of fat permeation seem to be due to the       
biological activity . pinocytosis is most representative, but the       
authors newly found several facts such as dissolution-like change in the
basement membrane and transport via the stroma cell . the authors       
believe that these results will bring a clue to explain the mechanism of
biological transportation of materials through the placenta .

the content of phosphatides, triglycerides and cholesterol in placentas,
maternal, fetal and new-born liver of the white rat .                   
  thin-layer-chromatographic examinations in the maternal rat liver     
showed different rise of the triglycerides and a significant increase of
the esterified cholesterol, however, no striking changes in the content 
of free cholesterol and lipid phosphorus with the fractions examined    
(lecithin, colamine cephalin, sphingomyelin and lysolecithin) .         
  as compared to the liver of adult rats, the fetal liver contains a    
little less than 50 per cent lipid phosphorus . the difference is       
conditioned by the concentrations of lecithin, and colamine cephalin .  
on the 19th day the content of triglycerides is lower than in the mother
rat . referred to the dry weight, there results a decrease of all       
phosphatide fractions, as well as of the free cholesterol and a slight  
rise of the triglycerides from the 19th to the 22nd day .               
  the rise of the phosphatide concentrations to the values of adult rats
occurs immediately after birth under the influence of milk food, which, 
moreover, leads to a considerable increase of the triglyceride values . 
phospholipid- and triglyceride concentrations of the placenta correspond
to those of the fetal liver . solely the content of free cholesterol is 
higher at the end of pregnancy . the content of triglyceride drops      
towards the 22nd day .

analysis of mammalian lens proteins by electrophoresis .                
  lens proteins of different mammalian species were analyzed by         
two-dimensional starch gel electrophoresis . the number of fractions    
detected by this means varied from 11-20 . a-crystallin was resolved    
into two to three components, b-crystallin into 5-11, and y-crystallin  
into three to five components . this technique provides a sensitive     
method for the fractionation of lens proteins and for analyzing species

an autoradiographic study on cell migration in the eye lens epithelium  
from normal and alloxan diabetic rats .                                 
  lenses from normal and alloxan diabetic rats with and without cataract
were investigated by autoradiography 4 hours, 4 days and 8 days after an
intraperitoneal injection of h3-thymidine (0.4 uc/g body weight) . the  
rats were made diabetic 8 days prior to the injection of thymidine at an
age of 4 weeks . the position of labelled nuclei of the lens epithelium 
was noted and their grain numbers counted . the diabetic rats had a     
lower frequency of labelled nuclei than the controls but after 4 hours  
their grain counts were equal . frequency diagrams of labelled nuclei   
are given for each of the three experimental periods . a predominant    
peak appears after 4 hours at a distance of 30-60 cells in front of the 
beginning of the nuclear arc . a successive shift towards this area was 
observed for the longer experimental periods . the shift of the peaks   
was more restricted in the diabetic animals . this result may best be   
interpreted as an effect of an increased time of cell generation .      
  as an appendix a histotechnique for the eye lens is given in          
collaboration with mrs. gertraude moewis .

lens development.. the differentiation of embryonic chick lens          
epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo .                                 
  the behavior of lens epithelial cells from six-day chick embryos was  
studied in three different experimental situations.. (a) explantation   
into several different fluid culture media, (b) explantation followed by
reimplantation into lensectomized embryonic eyes, and (c) explantation  
followed by reimplantation into the embryonic coelomic cavity .         
specimens were examined histologically, and the total volume of the lens
material of each specimen was determined from the planimetry of serial  
sections . the results were interpreted as follows..                    
  1. with a small amount of protein supplement in the culture medium,   
embryonic lens epithelial cells are capable of a limited amount of      
independent cytodifferentiation . without protein supplement they fail  
to undergo any fiber formation .                                        
  2. when returned to the eye environment, cultured epithelial explants 
will respond with a resumption of growth, with further cellular         
differentiation, and with at least some of the morphogenetic changes    
necessary to form a lens . the embryonic coelom will not support these  
responses .                                                             
  3. the initiation of the formation of lens fibers is not sufficient   
for their complete autonomous maturation .                              
  4. the internal architecture of the developing lens is not the only   
determinant of its overall shape .

treatment of active chronic hepatitis and lupoid hepatitis with

  6-mercaptopurine or azothioprine ('imuran') was used successfully in 3
patients with active chronic hepatitis and 2 with lupoid hepatitis, for 
periods up to 1 year . these drugs allowed modification and even        
abolition of discomforting corticosteroid regimes . their action in     
chronic hepatitis may be analogous to their anti-immune action in       
suppressing homograft rejection .

  two cases of systemic lupus erythematosus along with terminal uremia  
secondary to lupus nephritis are presented . both patients were treated

infectious, and immunologic problems were responsible for their death . 
there was no evidence of resurgence of lupus erythematosus in either

renal amyloidosis a clinicopathological study .                         
  the clinical and histopathological data from 40 cases of renal        
amyloidosis diagnosed by percutaneous renal biopsy are presented .      
  twenty-two cases were labelled as 'secondary' amyloidosis, as definite
aetiological factors responsible for renal amyloidosis could be         
discovered . the predisposing disease states leading to amyloid deposits
in the kidney in the order of frequency were fibrocaseous pulmonary     
tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, lung abscess, and ileocaecal tuberculosis 
five cases were labelled as suspected 'primary' amyloidosis as a      
definite evidence of the predisposing disease could not be obtained     
although the skiagram of chest revealed minimal healed foci . no cause  
could be determined in thirteen cases, which were, therefore, labelled  
as 'primary' amyloidosis .                                              
  albuminuria was a constant feature in all the cases and 32 cases      
presented as nephrotic syndrome . the rest of the cases presented with  
hypertension or renal failure in addition to albuminuria .

  a case is reported of a sixty-nine year old woman with severe,        
idiopathic, autoimmune hemolytic anemia which was initially controlled  
by splenectomy . a relapse associated with the development of severe,   
autoimmune, thrombocytopenic purpura failed to respond to large doses of
prednisone, but was controlled to a variable degree with imuran .       
  associated features included diffuse hypergammaglobulinemia, excessive
gamma-u proteins in the urine, idiopathic hypoalbuminemia with a greatly
reduced total exchangeable albumin pool, amyloidosis in the spleen and  
other organs, and diffuse plasmacytosis of the bone marrow, lymph nodes,

female . the diagnosis was established by renal biopsy in 19 instances  
and by autopsy in the others, with 18 patients considered to have       
primary amyloidosis and 8, secondary amyloidosis .                      
  the majority of the subjects died in renal failure with an average    
survival after onset of the disease of 17.6 months . the renal disease  
was indistinguishable from that seen in other forms of the nephrotic    
syndrome, with the possible exceptions of (a) a high incidence of       
purpuric skin lesions, (b) a low or negligible incidence of hypertension
(at times actual hypotension was prominent), and (c) a rapid and        
inexorable progression of azotemia despite persistence of the clinical  
and biochemical characteristics of the nephrotic syndrome . amyloidosis 
was found by percutaneous renal biopsy in 12 per cent of 83 adults with 
the nephotic syndrome .                                                 
  corticosteroids did not appear to affect the progress of the disease  
and were neither beneficial nor detrimental . in view of the high       
incidence of deleterious side effects of prolonged corticosteroid       
therapy and the availability of potent diuretic agents which may be     
helpful in relieving edema in this disorder, it is felt that            
corticosteroids are contraindicated in the treatment of amyloid         
nephrotic syndrome .

renal amyloidosis.. a biopsy study .                                    
  the relationship of the amount of amyloid deposition in the kidney to 
the clinical picture is reviewed in 14 cases of renal amyloidosis       
diagnosed by renal biopsy . the large percentage of patients who had the
nephrotic syndrome (11 patients) probably reflects the criteria for     
renal biopsy at this institution . the etiology of the amyloid          
deposition did not seem to be clearly correlated with either the amount 
of amyloid deposition in the kidney or the severity of the clinical     
renal disease . all patients had deposits in the glomerulus, and the    
heavier the deposition the severer the renal disease . of 7 patients who
had biopsy of the bone marrow, all had abnormal types or numbers of     
plasma cells . the age range in primary amyloidosis appeared to be about
the same as that in amyloidosis secondary to myeloma . amyloidosis      
should be suspected in patients with proteinuria, the nephrotic         
syndrome, or renal failure .

selectivity of protein excretion in patients with the nephrotic syndrome.
  with a gel diffusion precipitin technique and commercially prepared   
antisera, urine/plasma ratios of specific proteins were determined .    
individual protein clearances, expressed as a percentage of transferrin 
clearance, were plotted as ordinates against respective molecular       
weights on a log-log graph . a straight line was evident graphically,   
its constants were estimated by the method of least squares, and the    
slope, expressed as , was determined . the slope of the line may be said
to express the degree of glomerular selectivity to protein excretion .  
sixty-five determinations were performed in 48 patients . 45 satisfying 
the usual criteria of the nephrotic syndrome .                          
  1) those patients with primary renal disease and the nephrotic        
syndrome who displayed high selectivity types of proteinuria ( greater  
than the average for the group + 1 sd) usually respond initially to     
steroid therapy, regardless of the acute or subacute glomerular changes 
observed on renal biopsy .                                              
  2) those patients with chronic renal disease and the nephrotic        
syndrome display an average and frequently a low selectivity type of    
proteinuria .                                                           
  3) there appears to be no characteristic type of selectivity for a    
given pathologic group of patients with the nephrotic syndrome .        
  4) the degree of selective protein excretion is not related to the    
total daily amount of protein being excreted at any one time and remains
fairly constant despite fluctuation in the amount of protein being      
excreted .                                                              
  5) there is a slight correlation of borderline significance between   
the degree of selective protein excretion and the duration of the       
disease, and the initial para-aminohippuric acid clearance .            
  6) a statistically significant correlation exists between the initial 
blood urea nitrogen or inulin clearance and the selectivity type of     
protein excretion . those patients who were not azotemic and had        
initially near-normal inulin clearances had an average selectivity type 
or better .                                                             
  7) it is suggested that if the adult patient is initially azotemic and
has a grossly abnormal inulin clearance, response to therapy is         
unlikely, whereas if the blood urea nitrogen is normal and the inulin   
clearance is near normal, response to therapy cannot be predicted with  
any degree of accuracy . further studies of adult patients with the     
nephrotic syndrome are required to substantiate this premise .

excretion patterns of urinary metabolites of estradiol-4-c14 in         
postmenopausal women with benign and malignant disease of the breast .

estradiol-4-c1j administered to a group of 43 postmenopausal women, 38  
with advanced mammary carcinoma prior to endocrine therapy and 5 with   
benign mammary dysplasia, is reported . a chromatographic method was    
employed for the determination of estradiol, estrone, and estriol and   
other estrogen metabolites . the urinary excretion pattern is defined by
(a) the extent of excretion of isotope in each of 3 successive 24-hr.   
collection periods, (b) the percentage of the urinary radiometabolites  
enzymatically hydrolyzed, (c) the relative concentration of the several 
metabolites in the hydrolyzed fraction . wide subject-to-subject        
variations were found . the metabolites other than estradiol, estrone,  
and estriol comprised a large portion of the total estrogens excreted . 
a significantly lower amount of estradiol was noted in the group of     
women with mammary carcinoma as compared to the amount found in the     
group of women with benign mammary dysplasia, suggesting that the former
group metabolizes more rapidly the administered estradiol . although the
excretion patterns of patients who failed to respond to estrogen        
treatment (nonresponders) differed the greatest from the patterns       
associated with benign disease, distinctive patterns of the urinary     
excretion of isotopic estrogens which allowed a statistically           
significant or clinically useful separation between responders and      
nonresponders to subsequent estrogen therapy were not discovered .

the development of social attachments in infancy .                      
  this report is devoted to the formation and development of social     
attachments in infancy . it is suggested that the core of the attachment
function is represented by the tendency of the young to seek the        
proximity of certain other members of the species and that the most     
suitable operational definition may be found in the behavior of the     
individual when deprived of such proximity .                            
  the study takes the form of a longitudinal follow-up, in which 60     
infants were investigated at four-weekly intervals from the early weeks 
on up to the end of the first year and again at 18 months of age . with 
the use of an attachment scale, based on seven everyday separation      
situations, the following three main parameters were explored.. the age 
at onset of specific attachments, the intensity of such attachments, and
the number of objects to whom attachments are formed . a measure of     
fear-of-strangers was also included .                                   
  results indicate that the age at onset of specific attachments is     
generally to be found in the third quarter of the first year, but that  
this is preceded by a phase of indiscriminate attachment behavior,. that
the intensity of specific attachment increases most in the first month  
following onset and that thereafter fluctuations occur in individual    
cases which make long-term prediction difficult,. and that multiplicity 
of objects can be found in some instances at the very beginning of the  
specific attachment phase, becoming the rule in most of the remaining   
cases very soon thereafter . correlations between the attachment        
variables, as well as with the fear-of-strangers measure, are presented,
and an examination is also made of the conditions eliciting protest at  
proximity loss, of the manner in which protest is expressed, and of the 
conditions necessary to terminate protest .                             
  individual differences with regard to the three main parameters were  
explored in a subgroup of 36 infants . a number of variables were       
examined in relation to these individual differences, and suggestions   
made regarding the conditions which affect the manifestation of the     
attachment function .                                                   
  the data are discussed in relation to four themes which emerged from  
the findings.. the nature of the attachment function, its developmental 
origins, its developmental trends, and the influence of the social      
setting .

separation anxiety as a cause of early emotional problems in children . 
  in summary, three cases of disturbed behavior in children have been   
discussed, with particular emphasis on disturbances in feeding,         
sleeping, and motility . some of the hypotheses have been presented of  
why such behavior should develop,. the significance of attachment       
behavior and separation anxiety in infants has been particularly        
stressed . difficulties in mothering care are threatening to the child's
sense of security and lead to greater experience of separation anxiety, 
which may then be reflected in various disturbances or alterations in   
his behavior . this experience of separation anxiety is the result of   
early life experience, may reach pathologic proportions, and may account
for many later problems in children and adults .

  chromatographic fractionations have been performed on the             
ultracentrifugal supernatants of homogenates of rat lung and liver by   
the use of columns of dextran gel (sephadex g-100) . a major proportion 
of nickel in these tissue supernatants has been demonstrated to be      
firmly bound to macromolecular constituents . following acute and       
chronic inhalation of carcinogenic levels of nickel carbonyl, the       
predominant increases in the concentrations of nickel have been observed
in the macromolecular fractions . these findings are consistent with the
previous demonstration of nickel in purified preparations of ribonucleic
acids (rna) from several rat tissues, and with the observation of       
increased concentrations of nickel in high-molecular weight rna from    
lung and liver following the inhalation of nickel carbonyl .

  1. ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid reversibly inhibits the

intradermal test using cobalt chloride .                                
  selected groups of patients with cobalt allergy and nickel allergy as 
well as normal controls were tested intradermally with cobalt chloride  
in the dilutions 10 to 10 . reactions of the wheal and flare type appear
during the first hours and make the 24-hour reading misleading . the    
papular response to cobalt chloride 10, when read 48 to 96 hours after  
the injection, appears to be a reliable test for cobalt allergy .       
patients with combined nickel-cobalt allergy were excluded from the     
study, and the question of group reactions is not discussed . nickel    
allergics give a somewhat stronger reaction than controls to the        
slightly impure cobalt chloride . it would be preferable if the degree  
of purity of the cobalt chloride were ten times greater .

measurements of nickel in biological materials by atomic absorption

  an atomic absorption procedure has been developed which facilitates   
quantitative measurements of nickel in biological materials, including  
urine, ribonucleic acids (rna), and serum proteins .                    
  the sensitivity of detection of nickel by the atomic absorption       
spectrometer (0.10 p.p.m.) was insufficient to permit direct            
measurements of nickel in normal urine . therefore, it was necessary to 
employ a dimethylglyoxime extraction procedure to concentrate the       
nickel, prior to atomic absorption spectrometry .                       
  the coefficients of variation of measurements of nickel in urine and  
human b- globulins were 6.3 and 5.9 per cent, respectively . the        
recovery of nickel added to urine averaged 96 per cent, with a range    
from 94 to 97, and the recovery of nickel added to human b-globulin     
averaged 101 per cent, with a range from 96 to 104 .                    
  the mean concentration of nickel in 24-hr. collections of urine from  
17 normal subjects was 1.8 ug. per 100 ml. (s.d. = 0.8), with a range   
from 0.4 to 3.1 . the mean urinary excretion of nickel was 19.8 ug. per 
24 hr. (s.d. = 10.0), with a range from 7.2 to 37.6 .                   
  the mean concentration of nickel in 5 preparations of ribonucleic     
acids from ultracentrifugal supernatants of homogenates of rat lung was 
48 ug. of ni per gm. of rna, with a range from 34 to 64 . the mean      
concentration of nickel in 5 preparations of rna from ultracentrifugal  
supernatants of homogenates of rat liver was 29 ug. of ni per gm. of    
rna, with a range from 21 to 39 .                                       
  measurements of nickel were performed upon fractions of human serum   
proteins, prepared by continuous-flow electrophoresis, and by

  the time course and extent of the methemoglobinemia induced by        
intraperitoneal sodium nitrite and p-aminopropiophenone (papp) have been
characterized in female mice . the peak methemoglobin formation (34 ) is
achieved in about 40 minutes . comparable levels from papp (15 mg/kg)   
are achieved more quickly (between 5 and 10 minutes) but decline more   
rapidly to normal . both nitrite- and papp-induced methemoglobinemia    
afford a significant degree of protection against poisoning by sodium   
azide when administered in an appropriate time sequence . it was not    
possible under the same circumstances to protect mice against death from
fluoride, cyanate, thiocyanate, selenate, or borate, although some      
prolongation of survival time was seen after fluoride . the formation of
the azide-methemoglobin complex has been demonstrated within intact     
mouse red blood cells, and small amounts of the complex were identified 
in vivo in an antidotal situation . we think it important that the      
protective action of methemoglobinemia has been demonstrated to date    
only against established inhibitors of cytochrome oxidase .

  these changes seem analogous to the ones produced by alloxan,. these  
two poisons act at first by inactivating the sh groups, which leads to a
deficiency to which the b cells are very sensitive .

toxicity of sulfur-35, selenium, and tellurium to avian embryos .       
  continuous internal irradiation of chick embryos with sulfur-35       
administered on the 4th or 8th day of incubation produced abnormalities 
similar to those observed in selenium toxicosis of avian embryos . the  
highest level of sulfur-35 (1600 uc) injected into eggs containing 4-day
embryos produced morphological abnormalities more severe than those     
produced by the same level of radiosulfur administered to 8-day embryos,
or by any level of stable selenium tolerated . selenium at levels       
greater than 30 ug killed all the embryos within 24 hours after         
injection . nearly 20 times more tellurium than selenium was required to
kill all the embryos within 24 hours.. no abnormalities were observed in
the tellurium-injected embryos .

the effect of selenium on the upper respiratory passages .              
  results are reported of examination of workers exposed to selenium,   
with special reference to chronic changes in the respiratory passages . 
the findings are the same as reported in the literature . we emphasize  
the occurrence of teleangiectasias on the uvula and on the posterior    
palatinal arcs and on the epiglotis . we describe the occurrence of the 
first poisoning with selenium xyde in this country . the poisoning      
healed within a few days under symptomatic treatment . the patient had  
however to be transferred into another shop owing to frequent symptoms  
due to toxic effect of selenium . we report also on secondary findings  
in examination of chronic changes and we emphasize particularly the     
finding of profesional selenium external otitis .

the influence of small selenite doses upon the toxic fatty degeneration 
of the liver .                                                          
  sodium selenite (10 ug/kg) manifests a lipotropic effect after        
toxication of the rat by tetrachlorocarbon . this effect is absent when 
the selenite dose is increased to 50 ug/kg . the level of the total     
lipides of the liver after ethionine toxication is not significantly    
influenced by 10 ug selenite/kg . it is increased by 50 ug selenite/kg.
