correlation between maternal and fetal plasma levels of glucose and free
fatty acids .                                                           
  correlation coefficients have been determined between the levels of   
glucose and ffa in maternal and fetal plasma collected at delivery .    
significant correlations were obtained between the maternal and fetal   
glucose levels and the maternal and fetal ffa levels . from the size of 
the correlation coefficients and the slopes of regression lines it      
appears that the fetal plasma glucose level at delivery is very strongly
dependent upon the maternal level whereas the fetal ffa level at        
delivery is only slightly dependent upon the maternal level .

changes of the nucleic acid and phospholipid levels of the livers in the
course of fetal and postnatal development .                             
  we have followed the evolution of dna, rna and pl in the livers of rat
foeti removed between the fifteenth and the twenty-first day of         
gestation and of young rats newly-born or at weaning . we can observe   
the following facts..                                                   
  1. dna concentration is 1100 ug p on the 15th day, it decreases from  
the 19th day until it reaches a value of 280 ug 5 days after weaning .  
  2. rna concentration is 1400 ug p on the 15th day and decreases to 820
during the same period .                                                
  3. pl concentration is low on the 15th day and during foetal life (700
ug) and increases abruptly at birth .                                   
  4. the ratios rna cyto/dna and pl cyto/dna increase regularly from the
18th day of foetal life .                                               
  5. nuclear rna and pl contents are very high throughout the           
development .                                                           
  6. these results enable us to characterize three stages in the        
development of the rat liver.. - from the 15th day to the 18th day of   
foetal life.. stage of growth through hyperplasia without hypertrophy,  
  - from the 19th day of foetal life to the 3rd day of post-natal life,.
stage of cellular reorganisation,                                       
  - after the 3rd day of post-natal life.. stage of growth through      
hyperplasia and hypertrophy .

surfactant in fetal lamb tracheal fluid .                               
  lambs delivered by cesarean section with intact fetal circulation have
a fluid filling the trachea . analysis revealed that this fluid         
contained material high in surface activity in lambs delivered near     
term, but less surface activity in premature lambs .                    
  administration of 10 per cent oxygen to the ewe for 1 hour prior to   
delivery did not alter the surfactant properties of the fetal tracheal  
fluid .                                                                 
  two analyses of the fetal tracheal fluid revealed it to contain 146   
and 198 mg. of lipid per 100 ml., 30 to 40 per cent of which was        
phospholipid, part of the active component of surfactant .              
  the investigations reported here offer a model for further research   
into possible intrauterine factors in the pathogenesis of hyaline       
membrane disease .

placental and cord blood lipids.. comparison in a set of double ovum    
twins, a stillborn and a live-born .                                    
  1. determinations of phospholipid, total and free cholesterol,        
triglyceride and nefa have been made on placental tissue and cord blood 
in a set of double ovum twins, one stillborn and one live-born .        
  2. similarities occurred in all fractions studied except the cord     
blood triglyceride and nefa levels .                                    
  3. the serum of the stillborn infant contained one-third as much      
triglyceride and 21/2 times as much nefa as did the live-born infant .  
  4. the phospholipid content and the total lipid content of the        
stillbirth placenta were the highest studied in this laboratory which   
includes determinations on 26 live births .                             
  5. the suggestion is made that increased lipoprotein lipase activity  
in the cord blood may accompany intrauterine fetal death .

free fatty acid concentration in maternal plasma and fetal body fat     
content .                                                               
  subcutaneous injection of 200 u.s.p. units of heparin into female     
sprague-dawley rats produced large and sustained elevations of plasma   
free fatty acids but no significant change in blood glucose . a group of
pregnant rats received such injections of heparin 3 times daily         
throughout pregnancy . the fetuses from mothers of this group, at 191/2 
and 211/2 days of gestation, had significantly more body fat than the   
fetuses from uninjected mothers . the hypothesis is presented that the  
maternal free fatty acid concentration in part determines fetal fat     
accumulation . it is proposed that the body composition changes noted in
babies of mothers with diabetes might thus be ascribed to abnormally    
high maternal plasma free fatty acid concentrations .

the concentration of non-esterified fatty acids in maternal and fetal   
plasma in intact, alloxan-diabetic and x-ray-irradiated rats .          
  determinations of the non-esterified fatty acids in the plasma of     
pregnant rats showed that there do not exist any increases in the       
concentrations depending on pregnancy during the period from the 20th - 
22nd day of pregnancy . in the fetal plasma the concentrations of       
non-esterified fatty acids only amounted to 40 - 50 per cent of the     
maternal values .                                                       
  with alloxan diabetes produced 2 days prior to the test the           
concentration in the maternal plasma increased three- to fivefold, while
at the same time a significant rise was absent in fetal plasma with     
slightly increased average values .                                     
  whole-body x-ray exposures (dose.. 400r, dose output.. 40r/min) of    
non-pregnant female and of pregnant rats beginning on the 17th day of   
pregnancy did not result in any changes of the concentration of         
non-esterified fatty acids immediately after irradiation .

lipid metabolism in toxemia and normal pregnancy .                      
  the amount and fatty acid composition of total lipid extract from     
serum were examined in normal pregnant women in the first, second, and  
third trimesters, and early postpartum period, and in patients with mild
and severe preeclampsia and with essential hypertension . placentas at  
term were also examined for total lipid and its fatty acid composition .
in the normal women, total serum lipid increased during pregnancy . the 
rise was less pronounced in those with preeclampsia or hypertension .   
serum palmitate was mildly but significantly elevated in preeclampsia . 
total lipid and arachidonic acid were elevated in the placentas of      
preeclamptic women . the findings are compared with those obtained from 
animals developing eclampsia on an experimental basis .

essential fatty acids and acids with trans-configuration in the         
subcutaneous and visceral fat of the newborn .                          
  we made an investigation of the subcutaneous and visceral fat in the  
newborn . we estimated the contents of linolic and linolenic acid and of
acids with trans-configuration spectrophotometrically .                 
  we were able to show the penetration of these acids through the       
placental barrier . the essential fatty acid contents of fat in the     
newborn is low . in immature ones about 7-14 g, there is a rising trend.

acetoacetate formation by livers from human fetuses aged 8-17 weeks .   
  slices and homogenates from livers of human fetuses aged 8-17 weeks   
have a low rate of acetoacetate formation which can be raised by        
addition of acetate or octanoate to the incubation medium . it was not  
possible to demonstrate acetoacetate formation by isolated liver        
mitochondria from 17-week-old fetuses, probably because mitochondria are
injured during isolation .

changes in blood glucose and non-esterified fatty acids in the foetal

  changes in blood glucose and non-esterified fatty acids after         
intravenous adrenaline were measured in foetal, newborn and adult sheep 
in the foetus and immediately after birth there was very little       
increase in either blood glucose or non-esterified fatty acids after    
adrenaline . the response of blood glucose to adrenaline had reached    
adult levels at twenty-four hours of age . the response of non-esterifi-
ed fatty acids to adrenaline increased gradually over the first week .

electron-microscopic observatations on transference of fat through the  
human placenta .                                                        
  from the results of our previous and present studied on the           
transportation of fat through the human placenta by means of electron   
microscopy, we obtained the following conclusions .                     
  1) neutral fat can permeate through the human placenta without        
dissociation .                                                          
  2) almost all processes of fat permeation seem to be due to the       
biological activity . pinocytosis is most representative, but the       
authors newly found several facts such as dissolution-like change in the
basement membrane and transport via the stroma cell . the authors       
believe that these results will bring a clue to explain the mechanism of
biological transportation of materials through the placenta .

the content of phosphatides, triglycerides and cholesterol in placentas,
maternal, fetal and new-born liver of the white rat .                   
  thin-layer-chromatographic examinations in the maternal rat liver     
showed different rise of the triglycerides and a significant increase of
the esterified cholesterol, however, no striking changes in the content 
of free cholesterol and lipid phosphorus with the fractions examined    
(lecithin, colamine cephalin, sphingomyelin and lysolecithin) .         
  as compared to the liver of adult rats, the fetal liver contains a    
little less than 50 per cent lipid phosphorus . the difference is       
conditioned by the concentrations of lecithin, and colamine cephalin .  
on the 19th day the content of triglycerides is lower than in the mother
rat . referred to the dry weight, there results a decrease of all       
phosphatide fractions, as well as of the free cholesterol and a slight  
rise of the triglycerides from the 19th to the 22nd day .               
  the rise of the phosphatide concentrations to the values of adult rats
occurs immediately after birth under the influence of milk food, which, 
moreover, leads to a considerable increase of the triglyceride values . 
phospholipid- and triglyceride concentrations of the placenta correspond
to those of the fetal liver . solely the content of free cholesterol is 
higher at the end of pregnancy . the content of triglyceride drops      
towards the 22nd day .

analysis of mammalian lens proteins by electrophoresis .                
  lens proteins of different mammalian species were analyzed by         
two-dimensional starch gel electrophoresis . the number of fractions    
detected by this means varied from 11-20 . a-crystallin was resolved    
into two to three components, b-crystallin into 5-11, and y-crystallin  
into three to five components . this technique provides a sensitive     
method for the fractionation of lens proteins and for analyzing species

an autoradiographic study on cell migration in the eye lens epithelium  
from normal and alloxan diabetic rats .                                 
  lenses from normal and alloxan diabetic rats with and without cataract
were investigated by autoradiography 4 hours, 4 days and 8 days after an
intraperitoneal injection of h3-thymidine (0.4 uc/g body weight) . the  
rats were made diabetic 8 days prior to the injection of thymidine at an
age of 4 weeks . the position of labelled nuclei of the lens epithelium 
was noted and their grain numbers counted . the diabetic rats had a     
lower frequency of labelled nuclei than the controls but after 4 hours  
their grain counts were equal . frequency diagrams of labelled nuclei   
are given for each of the three experimental periods . a predominant    
peak appears after 4 hours at a distance of 30-60 cells in front of the 
beginning of the nuclear arc . a successive shift towards this area was 
observed for the longer experimental periods . the shift of the peaks   
was more restricted in the diabetic animals . this result may best be   
interpreted as an effect of an increased time of cell generation .      
  as an appendix a histotechnique for the eye lens is given in          
collaboration with mrs. gertraude moewis .

lens development.. the differentiation of embryonic chick lens          
epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo .                                 
  the behavior of lens epithelial cells from six-day chick embryos was  
studied in three different experimental situations.. (a) explantation   
into several different fluid culture media, (b) explantation followed by
reimplantation into lensectomized embryonic eyes, and (c) explantation  
followed by reimplantation into the embryonic coelomic cavity .         
specimens were examined histologically, and the total volume of the lens
material of each specimen was determined from the planimetry of serial  
sections . the results were interpreted as follows..                    
  1. with a small amount of protein supplement in the culture medium,   
embryonic lens epithelial cells are capable of a limited amount of      
independent cytodifferentiation . without protein supplement they fail  
to undergo any fiber formation .                                        
  2. when returned to the eye environment, cultured epithelial explants 
will respond with a resumption of growth, with further cellular         
differentiation, and with at least some of the morphogenetic changes    
necessary to form a lens . the embryonic coelom will not support these  
responses .                                                             
  3. the initiation of the formation of lens fibers is not sufficient   
for their complete autonomous maturation .                              
  4. the internal architecture of the developing lens is not the only   
determinant of its overall shape .

treatment of active chronic hepatitis and lupoid hepatitis with

  6-mercaptopurine or azothioprine ('imuran') was used successfully in 3
patients with active chronic hepatitis and 2 with lupoid hepatitis, for 
periods up to 1 year . these drugs allowed modification and even        
abolition of discomforting corticosteroid regimes . their action in     
chronic hepatitis may be analogous to their anti-immune action in       
suppressing homograft rejection .

  two cases of systemic lupus erythematosus along with terminal uremia  
secondary to lupus nephritis are presented . both patients were treated

infectious, and immunologic problems were responsible for their death . 
there was no evidence of resurgence of lupus erythematosus in either

renal amyloidosis a clinicopathological study .                         
  the clinical and histopathological data from 40 cases of renal        
amyloidosis diagnosed by percutaneous renal biopsy are presented .      
  twenty-two cases were labelled as 'secondary' amyloidosis, as definite
aetiological factors responsible for renal amyloidosis could be         
discovered . the predisposing disease states leading to amyloid deposits
in the kidney in the order of frequency were fibrocaseous pulmonary     
tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, lung abscess, and ileocaecal tuberculosis 
five cases were labelled as suspected 'primary' amyloidosis as a      
definite evidence of the predisposing disease could not be obtained     
although the skiagram of chest revealed minimal healed foci . no cause  
could be determined in thirteen cases, which were, therefore, labelled  
as 'primary' amyloidosis .                                              
  albuminuria was a constant feature in all the cases and 32 cases      
presented as nephrotic syndrome . the rest of the cases presented with  
hypertension or renal failure in addition to albuminuria .

  a case is reported of a sixty-nine year old woman with severe,        
idiopathic, autoimmune hemolytic anemia which was initially controlled  
by splenectomy . a relapse associated with the development of severe,   
autoimmune, thrombocytopenic purpura failed to respond to large doses of
prednisone, but was controlled to a variable degree with imuran .       
  associated features included diffuse hypergammaglobulinemia, excessive
gamma-u proteins in the urine, idiopathic hypoalbuminemia with a greatly
reduced total exchangeable albumin pool, amyloidosis in the spleen and  
other organs, and diffuse plasmacytosis of the bone marrow, lymph nodes,

female . the diagnosis was established by renal biopsy in 19 instances  
and by autopsy in the others, with 18 patients considered to have       
primary amyloidosis and 8, secondary amyloidosis .                      
  the majority of the subjects died in renal failure with an average    
survival after onset of the disease of 17.6 months . the renal disease  
was indistinguishable from that seen in other forms of the nephrotic    
syndrome, with the possible exceptions of (a) a high incidence of       
purpuric skin lesions, (b) a low or negligible incidence of hypertension
(at times actual hypotension was prominent), and (c) a rapid and        
inexorable progression of azotemia despite persistence of the clinical  
and biochemical characteristics of the nephrotic syndrome . amyloidosis 
was found by percutaneous renal biopsy in 12 per cent of 83 adults with 
the nephotic syndrome .                                                 
  corticosteroids did not appear to affect the progress of the disease  
and were neither beneficial nor detrimental . in view of the high       
incidence of deleterious side effects of prolonged corticosteroid       
therapy and the availability of potent diuretic agents which may be     
helpful in relieving edema in this disorder, it is felt that            
corticosteroids are contraindicated in the treatment of amyloid         
nephrotic syndrome .

renal amyloidosis.. a biopsy study .                                    
  the relationship of the amount of amyloid deposition in the kidney to 
the clinical picture is reviewed in 14 cases of renal amyloidosis       
diagnosed by renal biopsy . the large percentage of patients who had the
nephrotic syndrome (11 patients) probably reflects the criteria for     
renal biopsy at this institution . the etiology of the amyloid          
deposition did not seem to be clearly correlated with either the amount 
of amyloid deposition in the kidney or the severity of the clinical     
renal disease . all patients had deposits in the glomerulus, and the    
heavier the deposition the severer the renal disease . of 7 patients who
had biopsy of the bone marrow, all had abnormal types or numbers of     
plasma cells . the age range in primary amyloidosis appeared to be about
the same as that in amyloidosis secondary to myeloma . amyloidosis      
should be suspected in patients with proteinuria, the nephrotic         
syndrome, or renal failure .

selectivity of protein excretion in patients with the nephrotic syndrome.
  with a gel diffusion precipitin technique and commercially prepared   
antisera, urine/plasma ratios of specific proteins were determined .    
individual protein clearances, expressed as a percentage of transferrin 
clearance, were plotted as ordinates against respective molecular       
weights on a log-log graph . a straight line was evident graphically,   
its constants were estimated by the method of least squares, and the    
slope, expressed as , was determined . the slope of the line may be said
to express the degree of glomerular selectivity to protein excretion .  
sixty-five determinations were performed in 48 patients . 45 satisfying 
the usual criteria of the nephrotic syndrome .                          
  1) those patients with primary renal disease and the nephrotic        
syndrome who displayed high selectivity types of proteinuria ( greater  
than the average for the group + 1 sd) usually respond initially to     
steroid therapy, regardless of the acute or subacute glomerular changes 
observed on renal biopsy .                                              
  2) those patients with chronic renal disease and the nephrotic        
syndrome display an average and frequently a low selectivity type of    
proteinuria .                                                           
  3) there appears to be no characteristic type of selectivity for a    
given pathologic group of patients with the nephrotic syndrome .        
  4) the degree of selective protein excretion is not related to the    
total daily amount of protein being excreted at any one time and remains
fairly constant despite fluctuation in the amount of protein being      
excreted .                                                              
  5) there is a slight correlation of borderline significance between   
the degree of selective protein excretion and the duration of the       
disease, and the initial para-aminohippuric acid clearance .            
  6) a statistically significant correlation exists between the initial 
blood urea nitrogen or inulin clearance and the selectivity type of     
protein excretion . those patients who were not azotemic and had        
initially near-normal inulin clearances had an average selectivity type 
or better .                                                             
  7) it is suggested that if the adult patient is initially azotemic and
has a grossly abnormal inulin clearance, response to therapy is         
unlikely, whereas if the blood urea nitrogen is normal and the inulin   
clearance is near normal, response to therapy cannot be predicted with  
any degree of accuracy . further studies of adult patients with the     
nephrotic syndrome are required to substantiate this premise .

excretion patterns of urinary metabolites of estradiol-4-c14 in         
postmenopausal women with benign and malignant disease of the breast .

estradiol-4-c1j administered to a group of 43 postmenopausal women, 38  
with advanced mammary carcinoma prior to endocrine therapy and 5 with   
benign mammary dysplasia, is reported . a chromatographic method was    
employed for the determination of estradiol, estrone, and estriol and   
other estrogen metabolites . the urinary excretion pattern is defined by
(a) the extent of excretion of isotope in each of 3 successive 24-hr.   
collection periods, (b) the percentage of the urinary radiometabolites  
enzymatically hydrolyzed, (c) the relative concentration of the several 
metabolites in the hydrolyzed fraction . wide subject-to-subject        
variations were found . the metabolites other than estradiol, estrone,  
and estriol comprised a large portion of the total estrogens excreted . 
a significantly lower amount of estradiol was noted in the group of     
women with mammary carcinoma as compared to the amount found in the     
group of women with benign mammary dysplasia, suggesting that the former
group metabolizes more rapidly the administered estradiol . although the
excretion patterns of patients who failed to respond to estrogen        
treatment (nonresponders) differed the greatest from the patterns       
associated with benign disease, distinctive patterns of the urinary     
excretion of isotopic estrogens which allowed a statistically           
significant or clinically useful separation between responders and      
nonresponders to subsequent estrogen therapy were not discovered .

the development of social attachments in infancy .                      
  this report is devoted to the formation and development of social     
attachments in infancy . it is suggested that the core of the attachment
function is represented by the tendency of the young to seek the        
proximity of certain other members of the species and that the most     
suitable operational definition may be found in the behavior of the     
individual when deprived of such proximity .                            
  the study takes the form of a longitudinal follow-up, in which 60     
infants were investigated at four-weekly intervals from the early weeks 
on up to the end of the first year and again at 18 months of age . with 
the use of an attachment scale, based on seven everyday separation      
situations, the following three main parameters were explored.. the age 
at onset of specific attachments, the intensity of such attachments, and
the number of objects to whom attachments are formed . a measure of     
fear-of-strangers was also included .                                   
  results indicate that the age at onset of specific attachments is     
generally to be found in the third quarter of the first year, but that  
this is preceded by a phase of indiscriminate attachment behavior,. that
the intensity of specific attachment increases most in the first month  
following onset and that thereafter fluctuations occur in individual    
cases which make long-term prediction difficult,. and that multiplicity 
of objects can be found in some instances at the very beginning of the  
specific attachment phase, becoming the rule in most of the remaining   
cases very soon thereafter . correlations between the attachment        
variables, as well as with the fear-of-strangers measure, are presented,
and an examination is also made of the conditions eliciting protest at  
proximity loss, of the manner in which protest is expressed, and of the 
conditions necessary to terminate protest .                             
  individual differences with regard to the three main parameters were  
explored in a subgroup of 36 infants . a number of variables were       
examined in relation to these individual differences, and suggestions   
made regarding the conditions which affect the manifestation of the     
attachment function .                                                   
  the data are discussed in relation to four themes which emerged from  
the findings.. the nature of the attachment function, its developmental 
origins, its developmental trends, and the influence of the social      
setting .

separation anxiety as a cause of early emotional problems in children . 
  in summary, three cases of disturbed behavior in children have been   
discussed, with particular emphasis on disturbances in feeding,         
sleeping, and motility . some of the hypotheses have been presented of  
why such behavior should develop,. the significance of attachment       
behavior and separation anxiety in infants has been particularly        
stressed . difficulties in mothering care are threatening to the child's
sense of security and lead to greater experience of separation anxiety, 
which may then be reflected in various disturbances or alterations in   
his behavior . this experience of separation anxiety is the result of   
early life experience, may reach pathologic proportions, and may account
for many later problems in children and adults .

  chromatographic fractionations have been performed on the             
ultracentrifugal supernatants of homogenates of rat lung and liver by   
the use of columns of dextran gel (sephadex g-100) . a major proportion 
of nickel in these tissue supernatants has been demonstrated to be      
firmly bound to macromolecular constituents . following acute and       
chronic inhalation of carcinogenic levels of nickel carbonyl, the       
predominant increases in the concentrations of nickel have been observed
in the macromolecular fractions . these findings are consistent with the
previous demonstration of nickel in purified preparations of ribonucleic
acids (rna) from several rat tissues, and with the observation of       
increased concentrations of nickel in high-molecular weight rna from    
lung and liver following the inhalation of nickel carbonyl .

  1. ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid reversibly inhibits the

intradermal test using cobalt chloride .                                
  selected groups of patients with cobalt allergy and nickel allergy as 
well as normal controls were tested intradermally with cobalt chloride  
in the dilutions 10 to 10 . reactions of the wheal and flare type appear
during the first hours and make the 24-hour reading misleading . the    
papular response to cobalt chloride 10, when read 48 to 96 hours after  
the injection, appears to be a reliable test for cobalt allergy .       
patients with combined nickel-cobalt allergy were excluded from the     
study, and the question of group reactions is not discussed . nickel    
allergics give a somewhat stronger reaction than controls to the        
slightly impure cobalt chloride . it would be preferable if the degree  
of purity of the cobalt chloride were ten times greater .

measurements of nickel in biological materials by atomic absorption

  an atomic absorption procedure has been developed which facilitates   
quantitative measurements of nickel in biological materials, including  
urine, ribonucleic acids (rna), and serum proteins .                    
  the sensitivity of detection of nickel by the atomic absorption       
spectrometer (0.10 p.p.m.) was insufficient to permit direct            
measurements of nickel in normal urine . therefore, it was necessary to 
employ a dimethylglyoxime extraction procedure to concentrate the       
nickel, prior to atomic absorption spectrometry .                       
  the coefficients of variation of measurements of nickel in urine and  
human b- globulins were 6.3 and 5.9 per cent, respectively . the        
recovery of nickel added to urine averaged 96 per cent, with a range    
from 94 to 97, and the recovery of nickel added to human b-globulin     
averaged 101 per cent, with a range from 96 to 104 .                    
  the mean concentration of nickel in 24-hr. collections of urine from  
17 normal subjects was 1.8 ug. per 100 ml. (s.d. = 0.8), with a range   
from 0.4 to 3.1 . the mean urinary excretion of nickel was 19.8 ug. per 
24 hr. (s.d. = 10.0), with a range from 7.2 to 37.6 .                   
  the mean concentration of nickel in 5 preparations of ribonucleic     
acids from ultracentrifugal supernatants of homogenates of rat lung was 
48 ug. of ni per gm. of rna, with a range from 34 to 64 . the mean      
concentration of nickel in 5 preparations of rna from ultracentrifugal  
supernatants of homogenates of rat liver was 29 ug. of ni per gm. of    
rna, with a range from 21 to 39 .                                       
  measurements of nickel were performed upon fractions of human serum   
proteins, prepared by continuous-flow electrophoresis, and by

  the time course and extent of the methemoglobinemia induced by        
intraperitoneal sodium nitrite and p-aminopropiophenone (papp) have been
characterized in female mice . the peak methemoglobin formation (34 ) is
achieved in about 40 minutes . comparable levels from papp (15 mg/kg)   
are achieved more quickly (between 5 and 10 minutes) but decline more   
rapidly to normal . both nitrite- and papp-induced methemoglobinemia    
afford a significant degree of protection against poisoning by sodium   
azide when administered in an appropriate time sequence . it was not    
possible under the same circumstances to protect mice against death from
fluoride, cyanate, thiocyanate, selenate, or borate, although some      
prolongation of survival time was seen after fluoride . the formation of
the azide-methemoglobin complex has been demonstrated within intact     
mouse red blood cells, and small amounts of the complex were identified 
in vivo in an antidotal situation . we think it important that the      
protective action of methemoglobinemia has been demonstrated to date    
only against established inhibitors of cytochrome oxidase .

  these changes seem analogous to the ones produced by alloxan,. these  
two poisons act at first by inactivating the sh groups, which leads to a
deficiency to which the b cells are very sensitive .

toxicity of sulfur-35, selenium, and tellurium to avian embryos .       
  continuous internal irradiation of chick embryos with sulfur-35       
administered on the 4th or 8th day of incubation produced abnormalities 
similar to those observed in selenium toxicosis of avian embryos . the  
highest level of sulfur-35 (1600 uc) injected into eggs containing 4-day
embryos produced morphological abnormalities more severe than those     
produced by the same level of radiosulfur administered to 8-day embryos,
or by any level of stable selenium tolerated . selenium at levels       
greater than 30 ug killed all the embryos within 24 hours after         
injection . nearly 20 times more tellurium than selenium was required to
kill all the embryos within 24 hours.. no abnormalities were observed in
the tellurium-injected embryos .

the effect of selenium on the upper respiratory passages .              
  results are reported of examination of workers exposed to selenium,   
with special reference to chronic changes in the respiratory passages . 
the findings are the same as reported in the literature . we emphasize  
the occurrence of teleangiectasias on the uvula and on the posterior    
palatinal arcs and on the epiglotis . we describe the occurrence of the 
first poisoning with selenium xyde in this country . the poisoning      
healed within a few days under symptomatic treatment . the patient had  
however to be transferred into another shop owing to frequent symptoms  
due to toxic effect of selenium . we report also on secondary findings  
in examination of chronic changes and we emphasize particularly the     
finding of profesional selenium external otitis .

the influence of small selenite doses upon the toxic fatty degeneration 
of the liver .                                                          
  sodium selenite (10 ug/kg) manifests a lipotropic effect after        
toxication of the rat by tetrachlorocarbon . this effect is absent when 
the selenite dose is increased to 50 ug/kg . the level of the total     
lipides of the liver after ethionine toxication is not significantly    
influenced by 10 ug selenite/kg . it is increased by 50 ug selenite/kg.

selenium-caused tumours .                                               
  in 10 out of 23 heterozygous rats administered 10 mg na seo per 1 kg  
food (containing 12 protein) and surviving for 18 months, cancer of the 
liver (with metastases in the lungs) along with sarcoma and adenoma was 
recorded . in another series of the yet incompleted experiment the      
animals were fed higher quantities of protein and selenium . toward     
14-19 months in three of them sarcoma was noted.. in two sarcoma of the 
lymphatic nodes, and in one- of the mediastinum .                       
  it is suggested that the changes caused by selenium compounds are to  
some extent due to their antagonistic relationship with methionine .

ehrlich ascites tumor cells agglutination.. the interference exerted by 
epsilonaminocaproic acid (eac) and its acetyl derivative (eaca) .       
  the activity of epsilon-aminocaproic acid (eac) and of its acetyl     
derivative (eaca) was studied on antigen-antibody reactions, membrane   
antigens and immune globulins .                                         
  in vitro eac and eaca do not affect immune globulins, but they do     
alter the membrane antigens of ehrlich ascites tumor cells and inhibit  
the agglutination reaction induced by a specific antiserum . inhibition 
is only partially due to the antigenic alteration observed, and it      
represents more prominently a direct interference at the level of the   
antigen-antibody reaction .                                             
  the membrane antigen alternations induced by the drugs and by nitrogen
mustard were compared, taking into account their toxicity.. eac and eaca

mustard .

current status of hypothermia .                                         
  moderate hypothermia has been recommended for many and varied         
conditions . today its value is being questioned in the light of        
controlled groups of patients . at the moment its use is justified in   
certain cardiac and other operations where circulation may be           
interrupted for short periods.. in general surgical procedures where    
massive, sudden blood loss may be anticipated.. in neurosurgical        
operations where a /relaxed/ brain is required.. following acute hypoxia
such as seen in cardiac arrest.. and perhaps in the therapy of acute    
septicemic shock .                                                      
  profound hypothermia in association with extracorporeal circulation   
rests on shakier premises, but can be of value in major cardiac         
operations where asystole is required and in certain neurosurgical      
procedures where complete interruption of circulation is indicated .    
  there is a great hazard in the development of inadvertent or          
unrecognized hypothermia in the anesthetized patient . monitoring of    
body temperature is an important feature of the care of the patient in  
the operating theater and in the recovery room .

hyperglycemic coronary perfusion.. effect of hypothermia on myocardial  
function during cardiopulmonary bypass .                                
  in a series of 84 animal experiments hyperglycemic perfusion of the   
heart gave significant protection to the anoxic heart . this protection 
was evaluated by ventricular function and contractile force studies and 
was observed after aortic occlusion at 37, 28 and 10 degrees c .        
  metabolic data revealed a considerable myocardial glucose uptake,     
higher coronary ph, higher po and lower pco in the glucose-perfused     
groups as compared to controls .                                        
  a hypothesis for the protective effect may be an alteration in        
metabolic pathway and support of the myocardial enzyme systems          
associated with high glucose concentration and utilization .

specific carcinoembryonic antigens of the human digestive system .      
  a wide variety of human adult and fetal tissues were studied by       
immunodiffusion techniques in agar gel to determine whether they        
contained the tumor-specific antigen(s) previously found in colonic     
cancers . in the adult tissues it was demonstrated that identical       
antigens were present in all tested specimens of malignant tumors of the
entodermally derived epithelium of the gastro-intestinal tract and      
pancreas, but were absent from all other tested adult tissues . the     
common antigenic constituents, therefore, represent system-specific     
cancer antigens of the human digestive system . system-specific cancer  
antigens have not previously been demonstrated in humans .              
  experiments with fetal tissues demonstrated that identical antigens   
were also present in fetal gut, liver, and pancreas between 2 and 6     
months of gestation . these components were named /carcinoembryonic/    
antigens of the human digestive system . on the basis of the present    
findings and the recent work regarding control of the expression of     
genetic potentialities in various genetic potentialities in various     
types of cells, it was concluded that the carcinoembryonic antigens     
represent cellular constituents which are repressed during the course of
differentiation of the normal digestive system epithelium and reappear  
in the corresponding malignant cells by a process of                    
derepressive-dedifferentiation .

shown in the lungs and liver of mice infected with the pr 8 strain . the
inclusions contained particles of size and shape closely resembling the

comparative bone marrow study using two aspiration needles and two      
biopsy sites .                                                          
  bone marrow aspiration is now widely used in the diagnosis of         
hematologic diseases and many conditions not primarily affecting the    
blood system . a number of techniques have been devised by which a      
suitable specimen of marrow can be obtained with relatively little      
discomfort to the patient . the two needle sets described in this paper 
have been found to be equally reliable in obtaining bone marrow for     
microscopic study and diagnosis . comparative studies of bone marrow    
aspirated simultaneously from the iliac crest and the sternum in 26     
patients show no significant difference . however, there were four      
instances of dry tap at the iliac site . this fact, in addition to the  
observation that less discomfort was experienced by the patient when the
sternum was used, might indicate that the sternal area is a more        
reliable and efficient site for obtaining bone marrow .                 
  it was also observed during this study that patients experienced less 
discomfort when the university of illinois needle was used . the major  
objection to the use of this needle is the inability to obtain a bone   
core for biopsy .

the effect of dehydroepiandrosterone on the dehydroxycorticosteroids in

  the depressing effect of dehydroepiandrosterone on plasma             
corticosteroids is, on an average, shortened in advanced breast cancer  
(stage iv) . the lowest corticosteroid values have been found with the  
three groups of patients 6 hours after infusion of                      
dehydroepiandrosterone phosphate . the effect of dehydroepiandrosterone 
being, still provable after 12 hours with the group suffering from      
mastopathy, the breast cancer group of stage iv had at this time already
reached the level of the initial values . the breast cancer group of    
stage iv had at this time already reached the level of the initial      
values . the breast cancer group of stage i/ii behaved intermediately . 
the less lasting effect of dehydroepiandrosterone is attributed to its  
accelerated transformation in advanced breast cancer .

the meaning of ph at low temperatures during extra-corporeal circulation
  a review of the temperature gradients occurring during profound       
hypothermia is made in regard to acid base changes in general, and to ph
readings in particular . it is concluded that terms such as 'body',     
'mean', 'average' and 'core' temperature should be discarded and that   
when a temperature is quoted it should be referred to the site at which 
it was measured .                                                       
  the main circumstances in which blood ph is measured at a temperature 
different from that at which the blood is equilibrated with respiratory 
gases are reviewed by describing the changes which occur during         
tonometry experiments . in this way fundamental changes can be          
understood before considering the more complicated sequences of events  
taking place in the living body .                                       
  the alterations that occur in the concentrations of protein and       
bicarbonate ion when whole blood is cooled are reviewed, together with  
their influence on 'correction factors' . the reasons why these factors 
should not be applied to blood when the living body is undergoing       
hypothermia involving the use of an extra-corporeal circulation are     
discussed .                                                             
  examples of the numerical values for blood ph during the two main     
methods for producing profound hypothermia, one using autogenous lung   
perfusion and the other a pump-oxygenator are given, with reference to  
the influence of pco2 upon these values .                               
  the existing methods of acid-base measurement appear to be            
sufficiently accurate to reflect the metabolic component during profound
hypothermia .

  the human sarcoma hs has been grown in weanling rats treated with     
cortisone . this growth was modified by prior injection of various      
tissue antigens . active /immunity/ was produced by using human placenta
or embryonic tissue as antigen, and similar results were obtained using 
suspensions of rapidly growing human tumours .                          
  the response to other human tissues varied.. foetal muscle and spleen 
were active, whereas adult plasma was inactive except from some patients
with extensive malignant disease .                                      
  passive protection was produced by using certain human sera at the    
time of challenging with hs . sera from five women who aborted showed   
this characteristic . where the pregnancy continued to term,            
antisubstances were not found,. and they were present in the puerperium 
in only two out of fifty cases .                                        
  further groups of rats were given rat embryonic tissues as antigen,   
and the tumour challenge was then made with walker tumour,. the results 
were variable .                                                         
  with a benzpyrene-induced tumour in a pure line of /wag/ rat the      
effect was not obtained except in isolated cases .                      
  in experiments in mice, using as challenge an irondextran induced     
mouse sarcoma, prior injection with embryonic mouse liver or placenta   
increased the resistance to the growth of the tumour, but the tumour has
not as yet been produced in a pure-line mouse . on the other hand mouse 
experiments, using as challenge the crocker tumour, proved negative .   
  it is suggested that immune reactions may play a part in causing some

liver and plasma proteins of the rat .                                  
  it has been shown that glucosamine-1- c administered intravenously to 
fed rats is rapidly removed from the blood stream and appears first as  
trichloroacetic acid-soluble derivatives in the tissues . this is       
followed by a conversion to macromolecules . at least 80 of the         
administered compound can be recovered in tissues . the liver is by far 
the most active organ in accumulating glucosamine . this is rapidly     
converted to protein-bound components of the liver particulate fraction 
(microsomes and mitochondria) and is then released to the plasma without
appreciable accumulation in the soluble proteins of the liver . it is   
concluded that the glucosamine is transferred to the peptide chains of  
glycoproteins at some stage before these proteins are released from the 
liver particulate fraction .

  1. light microscopic observations on the development of the rat lung

  2. these same three stages can be identified by electron microscopy   
and all may be present in different parts of the lung at one time, e.g. 
at 40 and 45 mm. c.r. length .                                          
  3. in the glandular stage, the lung tissue itself has an immature     
appearance by light microscopy and by electron microscopy individual    
cells also are immature in respect of organelles . glycogen is present  
in immature cells .

vessels by a complete endothelium .

the pathogenesis of viral influenzal pneumonia in mice .                
  the pathogenesis of influenzal pneumonia in mice was studied by       
electron microscopy . mice were inoculated with 1.5 ld of pr8 influenza 
virus and killed at varying intervals after inoculation . observations  
by light microscopy were correlated with those by electron microscopy in
order to evaluate the lesions produced .                                
  at the periphery, the earliest lesions were focal areas of edema of   
alveolar lining cells, the capillary endothelium and the interposed     
basement membrane . this caused an appreciable thickening of the        
blood-air pathway . hypertrophy, degeneration and desquamation of the   
alveolar lining and proliferation of alveolar macrophages resulted in   
complete consolidation, which was progressive up to 1 week after        
infection .                                                             
  the central areas of the lung were affected somewhat differently . at 
3 days after infection, the nonciliated bronchiolar cells showed        
considerable hyperplasia of endoplasmic reticulum and apical cytoplasmic
edema . viral particles matured at the lumen surface of these cells and 
were then released into the bronchiolar lumen . the bronchiolar cells,  
both ciliated and nonciliated, underwent degeneration and sloughed into 
the bronchiolar lumen . the regenerating epithelium was stratified, and 
the surface cells were elongated and flattened . the peribronchiolar    
interstitial tissue gradually became totally infiltrated by cells,      
mostly of the mononuclear type .

studies on aging with horse crystalline lens gel as a contribution to   
biomorphosis of the mammalian crystalline lens .                        
  the effects of biomorphosis -dash the continuous material change in   
the chemical composition of the organs and tissues -dash are studied on 
the horse crystalline lens in respect of its amino acid content subject 
to substantial variations in the course of life . it is shown by        
electrophoretic and paperchromatographic methods that the qualitative   
composition of horse crystalline lenses remains quite the same, but that
within the individual age stages there occur quantitative variations    
between the individual amino acids .

the role of alveolar inclusion bodies in the developing lung .          
  the developing alveolar epithelium of man and rat contains            
characteristic inclusion bodies which are heterogeneous structures but  
basically consist of a system of membranous profiles and a limiting     
membrane of the unit type .                                             
  inclusion bodies appear to result from focal cytoplasmic degradation  
which occurs in the rapidly changing cuboidal alveolar epithelium . some
inclusion bodies in the developing rat lung are similar to the so-called
/lamellar transformed mitochondria./ however, evidence is presented     
suggesting that alteration of all cytoplasmic membranes may be involved 
in the process of inclusion body formation . certain images associated  
with the golgi complex are interpreted as early forms of inclusion      
bodies . there is also evidence that inclusion bodies enlarge by        
accretion of membranes which finally are extruded into the alveolar     
space . inclusion bodies are formed and /secreted/ in greater number    
late in fetal life and in early infancy, i.e., at the time when the     
cuboidal alveolar epithelium is differentiating to the mature flattened 
type . the latter contains no inclusion bodies .                        
  on the basis of the morphologic characteristics of the inclusion      
bodies and the distribution of the acid phosphatase reaction, it is     
concluded that inclusion bodies are lysosomal structures active during  
remodeling of the developing alveolar epithelium .                      
  the possible interrelationship of inclusion bodies and pulmonary      
surfactant is discussed .

postural changes in blood distribution and its relation to the change in
cardiac output .                                                        
  (1) cardiac output and the blood content indices of the several parts 
of the body were measured in 18 subjects including patients with various
diseases using external radioisotope counting techniques . changes in   
these 2 parameters induced by standing were compared with each other .  
  (2) average changes in blood distribution produced by standing were as
follows . decrease in blood content in the /lung/ (-25 ) and in the     
/heart/ (-26 ) and increase in the /thigh/ (+56 ) were statistically    
significant . no significant change was revealed in the /head/, /palm/, 
/liver/ and /abdomen/ .                                                 
  (3) cardiac output and stroke volume decreased by standing in most of 
the cases . recent data were added to those reported previously and were
treated statistically . average decrease in cardiac output was -13 in 6 
control cases, -35 in 16 cases with neurocirculatory asthenia and -35 in
10 cases with hyperthyroidism . the difference was significant between  
control and neurocirculatory asthenia . standing induced a substantial  
increase in cardiac output in a case of idiopathic nodal rhythm,        
although there remains a doubt whether it is the ordinary response in   
this disease .                                                          
  (4) significant linear correlation was revealed between per cent      
change of blood content in the /thigh/ or in the /lung/ and that of     
cardiac output or stroke volume induced by standing . minimal blood     
shift was observed when the latter was extreme, and vice versa . this   
implies as follows.. reactivity of the heart might be influenced by     
posture, and transmural pressure of veins and or capillaries is probably
adjusted, as in arterioles, to compensate for changes in cardiac output

comparative studies of the glycogen content of heart, liver and brain   
before and after iodine treatment and under conditions of asphyxia .    
  blood sugar level and glycogen concentration in the heart, brain and  
liver of rabbits after treatment with inorganic iodine, depot insulin,  
iodine and insulin combined, hostacortine and hostacortine and iodine   
combined are being examined . a control group remains untreated . in a  
second test series the glycogen determination under asphyxia (the       
trachea is being pinched off for three minutes) is repeated .           
  contrary to the brain the glycogen content of the heart muscle is not 
dependent upon the blood sugar level . after iodine treatment a lowering
of the blood sugar becomes noticeable, but also an increase in heart    
glycogen . the liver glycogen shows greater variations . the levels     
achieved in these test series therefore show no significant differences 
during asphyxia there is a significant lowering of glycogen in all    
three organs . preliminary treatment with iodine succeeds in stopping   
the lowering of glycogen in the heart muscle and the brain . the        
possible causes for this phenomenon are being discussed .

altered immunologic activity in sarcoidosis .                           
  studies in 16 patients with sarcoidosis revealed evidence of          
immunologic alterations other than impaired delayed hypersensitivity .  
transient impairment of the response of lymphocytes cultured from       
patients with sarcoidosis to phytohemagglutinin stimulation was found to
parallel the clinical severity of the disease . the hemolytic activity  
of serum complement was increased . a disproportionate increase in serum
iga was found characteristic of the hyperglobulinemia of sarcoidosis .  
these observations indicate that an altered immune response may be      
important in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis . a simple hypothesis as to
the specific kind of interaction of infectious agent and immunity which 
might result in the immunologic alterations observed is formulated and  
presented .

  the fine structure of inclusions found within the cytoplasm of        
macrophages of human lung, spleen, skin, lymph node, and rectum has been
described .                                                             
  the inclusions appear as concentric or whorled lamellae arranged      
around a core . each lamella is constructed of discrete, parallel       
filaments . the inclusions do not resemble currently described viruses  
or virus-like particles, nor do they resemble asbestos bodies or other  
known atmospheric pollutants or ingestants .                            
  there is some resemblance to lipid phase systems as well as mast cell 
granules,. possibly the inclusions represent partial intracellular      
digestion of phagocytized tissue membranes or ingested mast cell        
granules, respectively . differences and similarities exist between the 
inclusion bodies of macrophages and the granules of mast cells . such   
variations could be due to alterations in mast cell granule morphology  
before or after macrophage ingestion .                                  
  cytologic distinctions between macrophages laden with mast cell       
granules and mast cells proper, remains obscure and requires additional 
experimental evidence for clear electron microscopic differentiation of 
these two cell types .

particular, a marked reduction in the number of the prophases and an

rate of change of carbon dioxide tension in arterial blood, jugular

administration .                                                        
  1. the rate of change of p in arterial blood and cisternal c.s.f., was
measured following 5 percent co administration in eight anaesthetized   
patients undergoing routine air encephalography . ventilation was       
maintained constant throughout the procedure by a respirator . in three 
of the experiments the rate of change of p in the jugular venous blood  
was also measured .                                                     
  2. the rise in p varied between 25.7 and 14.8 mm hg . the final       
samples of blood and c.s.f. were taken 20-25 min after the start of co  
administration in five experiments . at this time the mean rise in p was
65.9 (maximum range 68.1-61.6 percent) of the rise in p . in the        
remaining three experiments the final samples were taken at 15 min when 
the rises in p were 53.2, 39.4 and 38.1 percent of the arterial change .
  3. the increases in p were 57.5, 76.2 and 76.1 percent of those in the
arterial blood . the changes in p in the c.s.f. were smaller than in the
jugular venous blood in all three experiments . in two of the           
experiments the final samples were taken 15 min after the start of co   
administration when the increases of p in the c.s.f. were 68.5 percent  
and 50 percent of those in jugular venous blood . in one experiment     
where the final samples were taken at 20 min the increase in p was 89   
percent of the rise in p .                                              
  4. there was a delay, following the start of co administration, in the
rise of p in jugular venous blood and in the c.s.f . this delay was     
about 1 min in the jugular venous blood but in the c.s.f. it varied from
1.6 to 4.2 min (mean 2.3) .                                             
  5. the rise of p in blood and c.s.f. was exponential . the rise in p  
in all experiments consisted of a fast component with time constants    
which varied between 0.2 and 0.9 min (mean 0.5) and a slow component    
with time constants varying between 6.7 and 14.7 (mean 11.6) .          
  the rise in p and p consisted of only one component . the time        
constants for the changes in jugular venous blood were 2.1, 3.8 and 4.3 
min, whilst in the c.s.f. they varied between 6.7 and 14.7 (mean 11.6) .
  6. it is probable that about 40 percent of the increase in ventilation
following co administration is due to stimulation of an area in the     
antero-lateral surface of the medulla sensitive to changes in ph or p   
(mitchell et al. 1963) . this area is superficial and ventilation is    
affected by changes in the p of the overlying c.s.f . it can be         
predicted from our experiments that the rise in p on co administration  
will take some 30 min to be complete . this may explain the slow rise in
ventilation on co breathing when compared with the rate of rise of      
arterial and jugular venous p .

studies on the compound lipids from x-ray irradiated animal, ii.

x-ray irradiated rabbit organs .                                        
  for the purpose to clarify the causes of x-ray disturbances a series  
of experiments have been conducted on biological and biochemical        
properties of compound lipids extracted from normal and x-ray irradiated
rabbit organs with a special reference to the p -labeled compound lipids
uptake, inhibitory action to l cell proliferation and uncoupling of     
oxidative phosphorylation, and the following results have been obtained 
  the compound lipids (lysophosphatide rich fraction) isolated from the 
x-ray irradiated rabbit organ have been found to possess a strong       
hemolytic action and also an action to inhibit the cell proliferation as
well as to accelerate the respiration of the mitochondria in the rabbit 
liver and spleen . it has also been proven that they act as to induce a 
marked swelling of mitochondria, to impede the formation of high energy 
phosphate as well as to act as an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation
in vivo . in the test to see the uptake of p -labeled compound lipids by
various organs, a marked uptake has been observed in spleen, bone       
marrow, and liver of both irradiated and non-irradiated groups .        
further, the uptake of p -labeled compound lipids in the rabbits given  
intravenous injections of compound lipid fraction for 30 consecutive    
days previously has been found to be greatest in pancreas followed by   
bone marrow, spleen, liver in the order mentioned in male group, whereas
it is greatest in spleen, followed by liver and bone marrow in the      
female group .

cesium-131 uptake and distribution in the human heart.. an analysis of  
cardiac scans in 104 patients .                                         
  when properly used, cesium-131 is a satisfactory agent for the study  
of cardiac morphology by photoscanning, which we believe is a useful    
adjunctive diagnostic procedure in patients for whom the results of     
other methods of evaluation are at variance with the clinical symptoms  
of cardiac disease . the studies reported here suggest that perhaps     
infarction of a subclinical type, size, or location may occur earlier   
than has been previously thought and that the damage it leaves may not  
be detectable by any means other than autopsy or a technique such as    
scanning . we have not yet been able to measure the actual concentration
of cesium-131 in the heart at autopsy so that the cold and cool areas

oxygen consumption of paralysed men exposed to cold .                   
  1. oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide output were measured when    
human subjects were cooled for 80-210 min . two subjects were normal,   
one had been almost completely paralysed below the neck by              
poliomyelitis, and two were unconscious as a result of intracranial     
damage and were observed with and without paralysing doses of muscle    
relaxants (d-tubocurarine and gallamine) .                              
  2. when normal subjects and unconscious subjects receiving no drugs   
were cooled, oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide output rose .        
  3. when subjects paralysed by disease or drugs were cooled, oxygen    
consumption and carbon dioxide output were not increased .              
  4. these observations are consistent with the view that in man the    
increase in metabolism on cooling for periods up to 31/2 hr occurs

heparin levels during and after hypothermic perfusion .

re-heparinization .                                                     
  2. heparin half-lives of approximately 13/4 hours and 21/2 hours were 
calculated during perfusions conducted at average temperatures of 31.5  
and 22.6 c. respectively .                                              
  3. the rate of heparin-loss during extracorporeal circulation is      
inconstant in an individual, and variable between individuals, so that  
exact neutralization requires an accurate estimation of the heparin     
concentration present at the end of perfusion .                         
  4. the protamine titration test provides a crude but simple and       
satisfactory means of monitoring free-heparin levels .                  
  5. complete neutralization of heparin is an important factor in       
minimizing postoperative blood losses .

one instance was it of a degree likely to be significant .

platelet sequestration in man . i. methods .                            
  current methods of labeling platelets with chromium using             
ethylenediamine tetraacetate (edta) as an anticoagulant were found to   
cause rapid hepatic sequestration of nearly all the transfused platelets
about 50 returned to the circulation but then were partially destroyed
in the spleen . less than one-third survived . evidence is presented    
which indicates that edta is injurious to platelets .                   
  when an acid-citrate medium that buffered plasma at ph 6.5 was used as
an anticoagulant, 36 to 85 of the labeled platelets survived (average,  
62 ), and marked temporary sequestration did not occur . studies in     
thrombocytopenic persons showed that circulating platelet cr activity   
measures the true survival of such transfused platelets .               
  the survival and sequestration of platelets were studied in normal    
subjects . the survival data support the concept that platelets die     
chiefly by a process of senescence . external scintillation scanning of 
the various organs suggests that normally the majority of platelets is  
destroyed in the liver .

acute leukaemia in which the association has been recorded, there were  
other possible leukaemogenic factors in three, and in a further three   
the drug had been given for only a short time before the leukaemia was

the phenylbutazone ingestion may have been associated with the          
development of the leukaemia . further studies, which should include    
matched controls, are indicated, and will be required before a definite 
opinion can be given as to any causal relationship between the drug and

radiocardiography.. principles and methods .                            
  the aa show the importance of radiocardiography, as a method to       
evaluate the cardiac output, the ventricular volumes and the pulmonary  
blood volume .                                                          
  in this first paper, they are particulary concerned with some         
technical aspects, which are very important to collect data .           
  the position of the collimator on the precordium, the injection of    
isotopes through a catheter, just behind the ventricle near the         
tricuspid valve, the selection of ratemeter constants the velocity of   
paper on the recorder and the way to read the area of the curve, were   
specially discussed .                                                   
  finally, they present the formula used to calculate cardiac output,   
ventricular volumes and pulmonary blood volumes .

reaction of the adrenal cortex during controlled experimental           
hypothermia .                                                           
  the stress reaction caused by hypothermia was studied in rabbits      
subjected to controlled hypothermia by immersion in an icebath . some of
the animals were re-warmed . to anesthetize the animals, pentobarbitone 
sodium (nembutal) was given intraperitoneally, and, in some cases,      
followed by ether anesthesia . further, the stress reaction produced by 
pentobarbitone alone was studied in five animals, and that of ether     
anesthesia alone in three . no anesthesia was given to the three rabbits
placed in the refrigerator . the variation in distribution and amount of
adrenocortical lipids served as an indicator for evaluation of the      
stress reaction .                                                       
  in all the hypothermia tests there occurred changes in the            
distribution and amount of cortical lipids, denoting a stress reaction  
brought about by hypothermia . in rabbits, the barbiturate did not seem 
to inhibit the stress reaction . this may be attributed partly to the   
test animal, as such and partly to the fact that shivering of some      
extent always occurred during the hypothermia experiments .

use of a cross-circulation technique in studying respiratory responses  
to co .                                                                 
  the effect of hypercapnia and hypocapnia on ventilation was           
investigated in cross-circulated dogs in which the recipient dog's head 
and neck regions were perfused by blood from a donor dog . hypercapnia  
of the donor dog was produced by administering co -o -n gas mixtures in 
the inspired air . hypocapnia was produced by hyperventilating the donor
dog with the aid of a respiratory pump . when the donor dog was         
hyperventilated, the ventilation of the recipient was maintained at or  
just below its resting level and it was independent of the arterial pco 
of the donor . the donor dog was apneic when the artificial             
hyperventilation was suspended and this response was not abolished by   
vagotomy . bilateral vagotomy caused an increase in ventilation in the  
recipient when its head was perfused by hypocapnic blood . bilateral    
removal of the carotid receptors did not influence the response to co   
qualitatively although there was some reduction in the ventilation of   
the recipient to cephalic hypercapnia . the ventilation of the recipient
dog was best correlated to the ph and pco of its cerebrospinal fluid in 
both hypercapnic and hypocapnic states .

action of phytohaemagglutinin in vitro on the lymphocytes of chronic    
lymphoid leukaemia .                                                    
  the in vitro action of phytohaemagglutinin has been the subjects of a 
comparative investigation of the lymphocytes of 13 normal subjects and  
of 15 cases of chronic lymphatic leukaemia .                            
  in both groups there is cellular change shown by the appearance of    
large basophil nucleolated cells showing mitotic activity .             
  in all the cases of lymphatic leukaemia the percentage of cells       
undergoing such change is lower than in normal subjects, and the        
transformation occurs more slowly .                                     
  the two phenomena are more striking the higher the initial            
leucocytosis .                                                          
  these results suggest, in chronic lymphatic leukaemia, the cells      
affected by the transformation are residual normal lymphoid elements .  
leukaemic lymphoid cells appear to be incapable of this transformation .

demonstration of ventricular aneurysms by radioisotope scanning .       
  radioisotope scanning of the cardiac blood pool after the intravenous 
injection of i -labeled iodipamide was carried out in 14 patients with  
ventricular aneurysm . in 4, the aneurysm could be demonstrated on      
neither the anteroposterior chest roentgenogram nor the scan . in 5, the
aneurysm was apparent on the radiograph, but the blood pool did not     
enter the area, suggesting a thrombus within the aneurysm . in 5, the   
aneurysm was detectable on the film and was also seen to be filled with 
radioactivity on the scan . presumably these findings showed that a     
thrombus had not yet formed . blood pool radioisotope scanning appears  
to be another tool in the diagnosis of ventricular aneurysm, useful also
in demonstrating in some patients the presence or absence of an         
intraluminal clot within the aneurysm .

propagation of lactic dehydrogenase-elevating virus in cell culture .   
  primary cultures of adult mouse lung, spleen, and liver and of mouse  
embryo support the multiplication of the lactic dehydrogenase-elevating 
virus . such cultures produced virus continuously until they had been   
subcultured 2-3 times . this corresponded to 20 weeks in the case of    
lung and spleen and to 2-3 weeks with cultures of embryo . viral        
multiplication was not accompanied by cytologic alterations in the cells
or by changes in their rate of synthesis of nucleic acids or protein .  
infection did not cause detectable changes in either the production of  
ldh or in its release from cells .

  cells of bovine embryonic lung tissue in culture were inoculated with 
simian virus 40 (sv 40) or a phenol extract of a high titer suspension  
of sv 40 . both the virus and the nucleic acid preparation induced      
proliferative morphological changes characteristic for sv 40            
transformation . non-infected control cultures and cultures which were  
inoculated with a preparation of nucleic acid exposed to dnase and      
maintained under the same conditions as infected cultures showed a      
regular fibroblastic growth .                                           
  cell lines of rapidly growing transformed cells have been obtained .  
most attempts to isolate virus from the transformed cells were negative,
but minute amounts of virus were recovered from occasional passages .

rapid transformation of human fibroblast cultures by simian virus 40 .  
  the risk of systemic embolism is assessed in a group of 754 patients  
with chronic rheumatic heart disease followed over a period of 5,833    
patient-years .                                                         
  the incidence of embolism was 1.5 per patient-year for the whole group
it was seven times higher in atrial fibrillation than in sinus rhythm 
when the duration of atrial fibrillation was known, it was found that 
one-third of the emboli occurred within one month and two-thirds within 
12 months after the onset of atrial fibrillation . the incidence of     
embolic recurrences was 8 per patient-year, irrespective of the nature  
of the cardiac rhythm, but 66 of the recurrences took place within 12   
months of the initial embolic episode .                                 
  mitral valvotomy did not eliminate the danger of embolism . it is     
questionable whether it reduced its incidence .                         
  anticoagulant treatment reduced the incidence of embolic recurrences .

sensitivity varies . if exposure is limited some tissues may recover .  
the effect appears to depend on oxygen tension rather than raised

attitudinal factors in congenital heart disease .                       
  this study considers the behavioral implications of congenital heart  
disease for the pediatric patient, his siblings, and his parents . the  
effects of a disease on the child, on his siblings, and on his parents  
and the interplay among these individuals are explored . the impact of  
the physician's diagnosis is illustrated by the induced significant     
changes in family attitudes, which are not necessarily related to       
disease severity or child incapacity .                                  
  poorer adjustment and anxiety in the cardiac child related more highly
to maternal anxiety and pampering than to his degree of incapacity .    
maternal protectiveness and pampering were significantly greater in the 
cardiac than in the normal group and were highest in the cyanotic group 
the best predictor of maternal protectiveness was maternal anxiety,   
and it was found that the addition of other variables such as incapacity
and child dependence failed to improve prediction substantially .       
maternal anxiety seemed related to the presence rather than to the      
severity of the heart condition .

maternal anxiety during pregnancy and adequacy of mother and child      
adjustment eight months following childbirth .                          
  fifty pregnant women were administered a battery of psychological     
tests . on the basis of scores obtained from the manifest anxiety scale,
these pregnant women were dichotomized into a /high anxiety/ group and a
/low anxiety/ group . eight months following childbirth, the mothers and
children were seen for a psychological assessment . it was found that   
the women in the /high anxious/ group evidenced significantly more      
negative childrearing attitudes . that is, the /high anxious/ mothers   
obtained significantly higher scores on the hostility and control       
factors measured by the pari . on the basis of the examiner's ratings of
the mother's personality traits, it was found that the women who were   
highly anxious during pregnancy received much less favorable personality
ratings at the time of the 8-month assessment . moreover, there was a   
significant difference in the proportions of mothers in the two groups  
who received a favorable rating from the examiner on the basis of his   
observation of the mother-child interaction during the session . in     
studying the children of these mothers, it was found that the children  
of the /low anxious/ mothers received a significantly higher            
developmental quotient on the infant mental scale . in keeping with this
finding, they also obtained a higher developmental quotient on the motor
scale, although on this aspect of the intellectual assessment the       
difference was not statistically significant . also, the children from  
the /low anxious/ mothers tended to receive a score indicative of a more
favorable general emotional tone than did the offspring of the /high    
anxious/ mothers . this difference between the two groups of children   
was not statistically significant . in general, the findings were       
consistent with the predictions that the children who were being reared 
by women who had been highly anxious during pregnancy would fare less   
well on tests of intellectual development and indices of emotional      
adjustment . the findings also were in keeping with the prediction that 
the highly anxious women during pregnancy would evidence less desirable 
parental attitudes during their child's early development and that they 
would present a less favorable personality picture at a time            
approximately 8 months following pregnancy .

maternal separation in the rhesus monkey .                              
  the present study involved separation of eight monkey mother-infant   
pairs for a period of two weeks and measurement of the behavior of the  
infants before, during and after reunion with their mothers, and of the 
mothers before and after reunion . all infants showed emotional         
disturbance in response to separation and drastic decreases in play and 
other complex social behaviors while separated .                        
  it is clear that infant-mother separation produces emotional          
disturbance in both human and macaque infants and that the patterns of  
responses following separation are similar in both species . the results
obtained in studies of monkey infant-mother separation indicate that    
sheer physical separation is the crucial aspect of maternal separation  
for monkeys . undoubtedly other factors associated with separation from 
the mother are vitally important for human children, and may account in 
part for the absence or rarity of the detachment stage (as seen in human
response pattern) in separated monkey infants . the overall results show
considerable similarity in the responses of human children and infant   
monkeys to separation from the mother .

the ophthalmologist's role in the management of dyslexia .              
  dyslexia is a clinical entity characterized by subnormal reading      
ability in a person of average or above average intelligence .          
  it is a disease which has different causes in different children . the
causes include brain damage in the /language area,/ hereditary          
predisposition and such ophthalmic factors as hyperopia, muscle         
imbalance, aniseikonia or visual immaturity . emotional disturbances,   
educational immaturity and cerebral dominance may also play some role in
the etiology of this condition .                                        
  the universal symptom is poor reading ability . however, these cases  
frequently have other associated symptoms such as poor writing,         
difficulty in reading and writing numbers, inability to read or write   
musical notes and disorientation for left and right . many of these     
patients develop personality maladjustments . visual fields often reveal
a hemianopia .                                                          
  in any group of poor readers, a large percentage will have ocular,    
neurologic, psychiatric or psychologic abnormalities and/or a strong    
hereditary tendency . the degree to which reading can be learned depends
upon the ability of the individual to adjust to the psycho-physiologic  
needs that are present at the time he reaches /reading age/ in school . 
if compensating abilities are present, and if the child's reaction is a 
favorable one, he may read well in spite of unfavorable factors,. if    
not, he may become a /poor reader/ . these children should be recognized
in their first year of school .                                         
  a complete medical work-up should be managed by an ophthalmologist . a
complete ophthalmic examination should first be performed and all       
possible visual anomalies should be corrected . the ophthalmologist may 
want a psychometric evaluation, a neurologic opinion to determine the   
role of organic brain damage, psychiatric consultation for evaluation of
emotional disturbances, pediatric consultation for evaluation of the    
status of the general health and/or consultation by an otolaryngologist 
to determine the patient's hearing ability . with all the necessary     
information at hand, the ophthalmologist will be able to recommend      
corrective medical therapy and to advise the parents and teachers about 
available remedial reading aids .                                       
  the prognosis is good for most patients since they are of average or  
above average intelligence,. nearly all cases can be helped .

  a case is reported with bitemporal relative hemianopia, craniotomy

arteries .

frontal lobes and vision .                                              
  the influence of the frontal lobe on vision is discussed based on the 
presentation of a rather unusual case . after the operation of a right  
frontal brain abscess, which never had led to papilledema, there was a  
pronounced diminution of the visual capacities of the patient,.         
gradually these disturbances regressed to the point of return of full   
visual acuity,. but there remained a hemianopic field defect . this and 
psychological defects in the sense of a partial visual agnosia (which   
latter are also regressing very well) prompted a discussion of those    
neuroanatomical and neurophysiological observations pertinent to the    
findings in this patient . the many data on the fronto-occipital        
connections in subhuman primates point to the role of the frontal lobe  
(area 8) in the development of visual disturbances in the sense of a    
temporary hemianopia with partial visual agnosia and some intellectual  
deficits . contrary to a single observation in an anthropoid ape, our   
case would seem to indicate that the aforementioned combination of      
symptoms may originate in the frontal lobe,. and we hope it will prompt 
other long-term follow-up studies of similar patients . the continued   
observation of this patient and perhaps of others will give a           
possibility to gain insight into the role of the frontal lobe in vision,
as has been assumed for animals .

evoked response in visual disorders .                                   
  1. erg and ver have been recorded from eyelid and lateral occipital   
electrodes in response to diffuse stroboscopic stimulation . in 45      
normal subjects ver was found to be composed of an early triphasic      
potential arising from the occipital region . wave i was present in 67  
percent of subjects, wave ii in 97 percent, and wave iii in 100 percent 
later waves were inconstant and contained components from the vertex  
reference . no overall asymmetry in ver from right to left was found in 
normal subjects, although average asymmetry with smaller side compared  
to larger was 19 percent 12.5 . on monocular stimulation the            
contralateral ver was regularly larger than the ipsilateral reflecting  
predominant retinal representation of the temporal field .              
  2. a statistically determined criterion of 50 percent depression in   
wave ii successfully identifies most patients with hemianopic defects   
involving the central 10 percent of visual field on tangent screen      
campimetry .                                                            
  latency asymmetry of six msec. or more and grossly asymmetrical       
aberrant wave forms are seen in some patients with diffuse cerebral     
disease and hemianopic defects .                                        
  3. severe or diffuse retinal disease is associated with alteration or 
loss of erg and ver on stimulation of the involved eye .                
  4. optic nerve disease is indicated by bilateral loss or suppression  
of ver on stimulation of the involved eye . erg is normal .             
  5. bilateral prechiasmal involvement is associated with complete      
suppression of ver . if only waves i and ii are lost, disease is        
probably, but not conclusively, demonstrated .                          
  6. involvement of nasal retinal fibres is indicated by reversal of the
normal contralateral preponderance of ver on monocular stimulation .    
these changes are observed in chiasmal disease .                        
  7. retrogeniculate blindness is associated with loss of early ver and 
preservation of late response . nonspecific projections are felt to     
contribute to the late cortical response to photic stimulation .

optokinetic nystagmus and occipital lesions .                           
  six cases are presented to invalidate the rule that horizontally      
symmetric optokinetic responses indicate a vascular etiology in patients
with occipital lobe type hemianopias . the converse of this rule is, in 
our experience, still a valuable observation . that is, asymmetry of    
horizontal optokinetic responses accompanying an occipital type field   
defect is a strong indication of a mass lesion . optokinetic nystagmus  
may be helpful, therefore, as corroborative evidence in diagnosing      
occipital lobe tumor but not in ruling it out .

disturbances of the verbal body image.. a particular syndrome of sensory

  1. the pto syndrome of the dominant hemisphere varies according to the
extent and depth of the lesion in the angular and supramarginal areas . 
the mildest clinical syndrome consists of a vague contralateral sensory 
impairment associated with dyscalculia, dysgraphia, dyslexia and        
difficulty in naming . a more extensive lesion is needed to cause the   
wide variety of classical signs described in parietal lobe disease,     
among them being gerstmann's syndrome, which is usually found in        
association with other manifestations of parietal loss (case 1) . an    
even more extensive corticosubcortical lesion in the area leads to      
complete disintegration of naming and understanding of speech (cases 3, 
4 and 5) .                                                              
  2. attention is drawn to the difficulties arising from lack of        
differentiation between the concrete gnostic body image and the abstract
verbal body image in investigation of these patients . the aphasic      
syndrome should be differentiated from disturbances of gnosis by        
application of separate, non-verbal methods of testing to elicit the    
impairment of the gnostic body image . the latter may be well           
compensated for and it is apparently unimpaired in the presence of an   
aphasic syndrome limited to the verbal body image .                     
  3. disturbances of speech in pto lesions if investigated along        
quantitative scales of impairment of repetition, understanding and      
naming, show a regular interrelation . nomination is the most affected, 
understanding is less affected . repetition is the best preserved       
function (cases 1-4) . the same interrelation of these functions is     
found with regard to the verbal body image . however, understanding and 
naming of parts of the body show far greater disintegration than        
understanding and naming of any other categories of words (all cases    
presented here) . if the aphasic syndrome is subsiding, finger aphasia  
with some other minor disturbances of verbal body image associated with 
acalculia may persist (case 1) . thus gerstmann's /finger agnosia/ may  
represent a partial impairment of the verbal body image and be limited  
to finger aphasia .                                                     
  4. it is assumed that the verbal body image differs from other        
categories of verbal symbols owing to the mainly proprioceptive,        
vestibular and tactile experience forming its specific physiologic      
background . telereceptive experience is of minor importance in the     
initial development of the understanding of words defining the body     
image .                                                                 
  in the patients described here, the selectively worse aphasic         
impairment of the verbal body image, as compared with other categories  
of words, seem to confirm this assumption .

chromosomal patterns in cancer patients during treatment .              
  radiation damages the chromosomes of human cells, and through         
short-term cultures of white blood cells some of this damage can be     
assessed . patients with cancer were selected for this study because of 
the large portions of the blood-forming tissues irradiated in the course
of treatment . chromosomal damage may be quantitative with variations   
from the normal number of 46, or qualitative, thereby showing structural
aberrations . counting the chromosomes in cells from cultures grown     
prior to therapy and at intervals during treatment enables us to        
determine the variation .                                               
  stained preparations examined microscopically allow us to recognize   
these abnormalities which are apparent before, during, and after        
radiotherapy . the damage appears to be largely random in the           
chromosomes affected in the different cancers, and the specific         
aberrations differ from cell to cell . however, there does seem to be   
some correlation between the appearance of persistent aberrant          
chromosomes and their frequency . while the peak incidence or /plateau/ 
may remain unchanged, the frequency may change .

a few interesting neurologic manifestations of migraine .               
  migraine is a complex vascular phenomenon presumably of genetic origin
which, through changes induced by either vasoconstriction or            
vasodilitation, can produce interference with the neurologic system and 
result in many bizarre and alarming clinical pictures . a few examples  
of the more interesting neurologic manifestations have been shown .

visual neglect .                                                        
  clinical trainees in nursing and in psychology from boston college and
simmons college, boston, mass., collected data and observed patients    
under the direction of the authors in a pilot program designed to       
measure visual spatial neglect and to develop rehabilitative material . 
these measurements and exercises might also be used by nurses in their  
care of those patients who have had cerebral vascular accidents .       
  the diversity of daily activities in which the patient becomes        
involved during his hospitalization should provide some indication of   
the extent to which the compensatory visual neglect therapeutics have   
been effective . more formal estimates can be obtained by               
re-administering the battery of visual neglect tests at periodic        
intervals . nursing personnel adopting a program of therapeutics such as
this must bear in mind that patients suffering cerebral insult are      
usually less adaptive than their nonbrain-injured peers . they develop  
new habit patterns slowly and regression often will follow apparent     
fixation at a more adaptive level of response habituation(11) . however,
experimental inquiry has shown that the dimension of behavioral         
difference between the brain-injured adults and normal adults is one of 
degree rather than kind -dash a difference that skilled nursing can     
often reduce(12) .

respiratory changes after open-heart surgery .                          
  patients who undergo cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation  
develop significant alveolar-arterial oxygen tension differences and    
venous admixture in the early post-operative period . up to 50 of this  
abnormality is due to anatomical right to left shunting through the     
lungs.. the remainder is most likely to be due to ventilation-perfusion 
inequality . the changes appear to be completely reversible . the       
cardiopulmonary bypass procedure may be responsible for initiating the  
underlying pathology, since changes of this magnitude were not found in 
cardiothoracic surgery patients in whom this technique was not required

cardiac malformations associated with ventricular septal defect .       
  in this study, 46 necropsy-proved cases of ventricular septal defect  
associated with another anomaly but not part of a recognized complex    
were selected .                                                         
  the associated anomalies were classified as (1) obstructive or        
positional anomalies of the great vessels, (2) anomalies responsible for
additional shunts, (3) anomalies causing intraventricular obstruction   
and (4) aortic valvular insufficiency .                                 
  clinical findings were often those of the ventricular septal defect,  
and the findings related to the associated lesion were frequently       
obscure . even with special studies, including cardiac catheterization  
and angiocardiography, there was often failure to arrive at a complete  
diagnosis . the findings which led to an erroneous or incomplete        
diagnosis have been presented . when a complete diagnosis was made      
preoperatively, the procedures leading to it have been outlined . while 
the diagnostic approach varies with the malformations which may coexist 
with ventricular septal defect, it was observed that aortography and    
selective left ventricular angiocardiography were most commonly helpful 
in identifying occult malformations associated with ventricular septal  
defect . it is therefore recommended that complete studies, including   
left-sided cardiac catheterization with left ventricular                
angiocardiography and aortography, should be considered in all cases in 
which the clinical, electrocardiographic, and right-sided cardiac       
catheterization studies are not entirely typical for isolated           
ventricular septal defect .

anatomic types of single or common ventricle in man morphologic and     
geometric aspects of 60 necropsied cases .                              
  in 60 necropsied cases of single or common ventricle in man, four     
major unrelated ventricular malformations were found.. (1) absence of   
the right ventricular sinus, in 47 cases (78 percent), designated type  
a,. (2) absence of the left ventricular sinus, in 3 cases (5 percent),  
type b,. (3) absence or rudimentary development of the ventricular      
septum, in 4 cases (7 percent), type c,. and (4) absence of both        
ventricular sinuses and of the ventricular septum, in 6 cases (10       
percent), type d .                                                      
  three types of relationship between the great arteries were present.. 
a normal (solitus) interrelationship, in 9 cases (15 percent),          
designated type 1,. d-transposition, the transposed aortic valve lying  
to the right (dextro, or d), relative to the transposed pulmonary valve,
in 25 cases (42 percent), type ii,. and l-transposition, the transposed 
aortic valve lying to the left (levo or l), relative to the transposed  
pulmonary valve, in 26 cases (43 percent), type iii . in none was the   
inversus interrelationship, type iv, displayed .                        
  three types of visceral and atrial situs were found.. solitus, or     
normal, in 50 cases (83 percent),. inversus, an exact apparent mirror   
image of normal, in 2 cases (3 percent),. and heterotaxy, the uncertain 
visceral and atrial situs associated with asplenia, in 8 cases (13      
percent) .                                                              
  the 60 cases were classified segmentally, according to the anatomy of 
the three cardiac segments.. the great arteries, the ventricular        
sinuses, and the atria .                                                
  the classic single ventricle with a rudimentary outlet chamber was    
found morphologically to be a large left ventricle with a right         
ventricular infundibulum, the sinus of the right ventricle being absent 
(type a) .                                                              
  the myocardium of the right ventricular infundibulum, of the right    
ventricular sinus, and of the left ventricular sinus was identified by  
the distinctive gross morphologic characteristics of each .             
  the planes of the atrial and ventricular septa, and the relationships 
between the great arteries at the semilunar valves, were measured as    
projections upon the horizontal plane, relative to the anteroposterior  
line .                                                                  
  an approach to cardiac anatomy is presented which is segmental,       
morphologic and geometric . this approach has angiocardiographic,       
electrocardiographic and embryologic applications .

congenital heart disease in the adult .                                 
  events in the natural course of 310 adult patients with proved        
significant congenital cardiac anomalies have been reviewed to determine
incidence, longevity, complications and cause of death .                
  atrial septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus were the most       
frequently encountered lesions and comprised over one third of the      
entire series . ventricular septal defect and pulmonic stenosis made up 
almost a quarter of the group . twenty-two instances of the eisenmenger 
syndrome secondary to a variety of shunting lesions are included .      
  bacterial endocarditis, sudden death and cardiac decompensation were  
the greatest threats to these patients . symptoms were minimal until the
appearance of heart failure, which was the most common cause of death,  
especially with older patients . sudden death occurred most often in    
patients with ventricular septal defect .                               
  although the clinical features are usually characteristic of a        
congenital malformation, young adults with acyanotic congenital heart   
disease are often misdiagnosed as rheumatic,. and in older patients,    
presenting manifestations are frequently attributed to arteriosclerotic 
heart disease . at times an associated acquired cardiovascular disorder 
may alter the basic syndrome .                                          
  three quarters of the patients survive and continue under observation 
the ability of many to live active, productive lives and to withstand 
stress, surgery, both cardiac and non-cardiac, and pregnancy was        
impressive . further observation of the patient with congenital heart   
disease but without surgical intervention is essential for accurate     
evaluation of the long term efficacy of cardiac surgery .

  clinical, electrocardiographic, radiographic, and hemodynamic findings
in 12 children with the combination of a ventricular septal defect and  
aortic insufficiency are presented . the left-to-right shunt was        
determined to be small or moderate in all, and significant aortic       
insufficiency was documented by aortography in 11 patients . clinical   
indication of aortic insufficiency as manifested by an aortic diastolic 
murmur first appeared at an average age of 6 years in 7 patients, with  
concomitant widening of the pulse pressure in 4 . progressive left      
ventricular hypertrophy was noted electrocardiographically, with        
progressive cardiac hypertrophy and aortic dilatation on x-ray          
examination in 2 patients . progression of the hemodynamic disability

ventricular septal defect and aortic regurgitation clinical, hemodynamic
and surgical considerations .                                           
  the clinical, hemodynamic, angiographic and anatomic findings in      
fifteen patients with ventricular septal defect complicated by aortic   
regurgitation are presented . in this combination of malformations the  
aortic regurgitation is acquired and results from prolapse of an aortic 
valve leaflet into the septal defect . the strategic location of the    
septal defect in relation to the aortic leaflets appears to be more     
important to the development of this complication than the size of the  
defect or the magnitude of the shunt through it . the onset of aortic   
regurgitation occurs during early childhood and, once present, tends to 
become more severe . careful observation of patients with these defects 
is indicated following the appearance of aortic regurgitation since     
rapid progression to severe left ventricular failure is not uncommon .  
ventricular septal defect and aortic regurgitation must be distinguished
from other cardiovascular abnormalities producing a wide pulse pressure 
with a continuous or to-and-fro murmur . cardiac catheterization and    
thoracic aortography are the diagnostic procedures most helpful in this 
differentiation . the operative treatment of ventricular septal defect  
and aortic regurgitation is reviewed and, on the basis of the present   
and previously reported results, suggested plans for surgical management
are presented .

  1. the aortic and mitral valves can be operated upon successfully and 
totally replaced with a prosthetic device of the ball-valve type with   
good long-term results . seventy-four cases are reported .              
  2. in aortic valvular disease the outcome in the immediate            
postoperative period is influenced primarily by the presence of calcific
aortic stenosis as well as the presence or absence of disease in the    
coronary arteries .                                                     
  3. we have significantly decreased the appearance of a low-output     
syndrome postoperatively in patients who are suffering from severe      
mitral disease by leaving the papillary muscle-chordae tendineae-mural  
leaflet relationship intact . we feel this adds strength to each

effects of aortic regurgitation on left ventricular performance direct  
determinations of aortic blood flow before and after valve replacement .
  the volume of regurgitant blood flow and its effects on the           
performance of the left ventricle were assessed at operation in 14      
patients with varying degrees of aortic regurgitation . instantaneous   
forward and regurgitant flows in the ascending aorta were measured with 
a sine-wave electromagnetic flowmeter simultaneously with left          
ventricular and aortic pressures . in eight patients who had aortic     
regurgitation without associated stenosis, 63 to 75 percent of the total
forward stroke volume regurgitated during the succeeding diastole . the 
calculated regurgitant orifice areas ranged from 0.13 to 0.44 cm /m .   
after replacement of the aortic valve with a starr-edwards prosthesis,  
the absence of regurgitant flow was proved in every patient, and the    
records of aortic blood flow closely resembled those seen in patients   
with normal aortic valves . net forward blood flow increased by an      
average of 60 percent, total left ventricular stroke volume fell 42     
percent, and the mean aortic pressure rose 29 percent . the pressure    
work of the left ventricle was elevated preoperatively in five of the   
eight patients (average 89 g-m stroke/m ) and fell significantly to an  
average of 34 g-m stroke m after valve replacement . kinetic ventricular
work was high in seven of the eight patients and comprised 10 percent of
total work before replacement but only 4.8 percent afterward .          
  similar observations were made in five patients with aortic stenosis  
and associated aortic regurgitation, ranging in severity from 24 to 72  
percent of total forward stroke volume . in four patients in whom the   
valve was replaced, no residual regurgitation was present afterward, and
net forward flow rose an average of 49 percent . kinetic left           
ventricular work was extremely high in every patient and averaged 26    
percent of total work preoperatively and 13 percent after valve         
replacement . in this group, pressure work was variable both before and 
after operation .                                                       
  the studies described provide definitive information concerning the   
effects of aortic valve disease on left ventricular performance in man  
and document the favorable changes in flow, pressure, and left          
ventricular work which immediately follow aortic valve replacement .

b in hepato-splenic bilharziasis .                                      
  the absorbed plasma radioactivity and hepatic uptake of orally

early effects of digitalis on central hemodynamics in normal subjects .

  1. an early significant reduction of heart rate .                     
  2. a significant transient reduction of cardiac output .              
  3. a significant increase of the stroke volume initially accompanied  
by a significant rise of the end-diastolic volume with unchanged        
systolic rate of emptying . the increase of end-diastolic volume seems  
to be related to the lengthening of the diastolic filling period . later
on, the systolic emptying rate increases, and the ventricular volumes   
decrease, suggesting an inotropic effect of the drug .                  
  4. a significant increase of pulmonary blood volume, parallel to the  
increase of the stroke volume, suggestive of a passive relation between

  in 23 patients undergoing open-heart surgery in whom the pericardial  
contents were accurately measured, and in 11 additional patients        
examined at autopsy or by pericardiocentesis, isotopic photoscans of the
heart were made and the results were correlated .                       
  the most accurate means of diagnosis of pericardial effusion was found
to be the ratio of the maximum transverse cardiac diameters on scan and 
roentgenogram . in patients with less than 100 cc of pericardial fluid  
this ratio was greater than 0.80, and it was less than this in cases of 
effusion of 200 cc or more .                                            
  measurement of the difference of these diameters, and visible         
separation of the cardiac blood pool from the pulmonary vasculature and 
liver aided in the diagnosis .                                          
  pericardial effusions of 200-300 cc or greater can be detected by     
isotopic photoscanning . although cardiac dilatation and/or hypertrophy 
decrease the sensitivity of the technique somewhat, a definite diagnosis
of pericardial effusion can be made even when cardiomegaly exists .

aneurysm of the membranous septum .                                     
  1. aneurysms of the membranous septum are relatively rare lesions     
presumably developing on a congenital basis . these aneurysms originate 
in the left ventricle immediately beneath the aortic valve and bulge    
into the right ventricle, the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve or  
into the right atrium .                                                 
  2. many of these aneurysms do not produce symptoms . others may cause 
right ventricular outflow tract obstruction or may rupture and result in
a septal defect . the resulting shunt will be from the left ventricle   
into the right atrium or ventricle .                                    
  3. an aneurysm of the membranous septum may be an isolated abnormality
or be associated with other congenital cardiac defects, particularly    
aortic valvular insufficiency . membranous septal aneurysms may be the  
site of bacterial endocarditis or thrombus formation .                  
  4. aneurysms resembling those arising from the membranous septum may  
occur as part of the complex of deformities produced by an endocardial

  in normal rats and after total body irradiation with 550 r of x-rays, 
the fate in the bone marrow of labeled nucleated and red cells of       
transfused peripheral blood was observed autoradiographically .         
  labeled nucleated cells, most of which were lymphocyte-like cells,    
readily migrated into the marrow parenchyma in normal animals (2 cells/ 
1,000 parenchymal cells/hr.) . following irradiation to at least 27-51  
hr., this migration appeared to be relatively increased . beyond this   
time, parenchymal areas were more difficult to be defined as such .     
  labeled red cells were rarely observed to enter parenchyma despite the
presence of nonlabeled erythrocytes within the parenchymal structure    
after irradiation .                                                     
  the vascular bed following irradiation increased greatly as the       
parenchyma diminished to a minimum of less than 10 percent control at 75
hr . despite these changes in the architecture of the marrow, the       
average density of labeled cells per area of marrow corresponded to     
values expected on the assumption of a free-flowing circulation . the   
technique used at present did not allow us to distinguish, at all times,
between a free-flowing circulation through intact sinusoids or through  
areas in which the sinusoidal wall, as such, was destroyed .

factors limiting survival after circulatory occlusion under hypothermia 
and hyperbaric oxygenation .                                            
  thirty minutes of circulatory occlusion with mild hypothermia and     
hyperbaric oxygen ventilation resulted in a mortality of 83.3 percent in
animals . when coronary perfusion from a reservoir was added, the       
mortality rate was 22 percent . ventricular fibrillation was much more  
easily reversed after coronary perfusion . there was no evidence of     
brain damage in survivors which leads to the conclusion that the brain  
tolerates circulatory arrest better than the heart under these          
conditions .

the effect of hypothermia on circulatory reflexes in the human .        
  total circulatory occlusion and release result in hemodynamic         
phenomena which provide an index of integrity of some cardiovascular    
reflexes . these include carotid sinus and aortic baroceptors,          
arteriolar vasomotor tone, and venomotor reactivity .                   
  baroceptor depression appears at a more moderate level of cooling than
does the sympathetic, vasomotor, depression . below 28 degrees c. both  
are significantly depressed, although probably not totally abolished .  
  the level of 28 degrees c. is a critical physiological level and may  
represent an important limit in the clinical use of hypothermia .

studies in perfusion hypothermia with special reference to /deep        
hypothermia/ and circulatory arrest .                                   
  1. perfusion hypothermia produces large temperature gradients within  
the body since organs are cooled roughly in proportion to their basal   
blood flows . the difference between the coldest and the warmest portion
of the body after 30 minutes of perfusion exceeds 25 c .                
  2. the average body temperature, which provides a proper measure of   
total body cooling, may be calculated from the arteriovenous temperature
difference and the extracorporeal flow rate .                           
  3. true /deep/ hypothermia is not obtainable by reasonable periods of 
perfusion alone .                                                       
  4. an important rise of core temperatures occurs during circulatory   
arrest in hypothermia because of relatively high average body           
temperature .                                                           
  5. high average body temperatures lead to continuing production of    
lactic acid in muscle tissue, whereas low core temperatures impair      
lactic acid metabolism . thus metabolic acidosis is progressive in      
prolonged perfusion hypothermia, and is accentuated by total circulatory
arrest . progressive acidosis may be minimized by uniform profound      
cooling by combining external with perfusion hypothermia .              
  6 diluents appear to have little effect on total body heat exchange   
during perfusion cooling .                                              
  7. perfusion warming has a differentially greater effect on core      
organs . though these are readily brought to a normal range, much of the
animal may remain cold .

nickel carbonyl.. its detection and potential for formation .           
  recent recommendations for control of nickel carbonyl exposures have  
been considered in the design of a simple, sensitive field method for   
sampling nickel carbonyl in air and process gases . the method involves 
collection in dilute aqueous hcl, ph adjustment, nickel complex         
development with alpha-furildioxime, and extraction with chloroform .   
color intensity is compared visually (or for greater accuracy,          
spectrophotometrically) with liquid standards . sensitivities on the    
order of 0.001 ppm are obtainable . a detailed development of the

  x-ray emission spectrography has been applied to study of the         
elemental composition of human teeth, enamel, dentine and bone . the    
material consisted of eight crushed teeth, enamel and dentine powder    
separated from eighteen teeth, and four pieces of buccal cortical       
mandibular bone . the teeth did not have fillings . the whole material  
contained nineteen elements, of which the main ones were calcium and    
phosphorus . in all the samples of tooth material, there were found ca, 
p, cl, fe, zn, sr and k, and the bone also contained ni . the time      
needed for a semi-quantitative analysis compares very favourably with

a kinetic study of nickel(ii), complexes of sulfur-containing amino acid
  the rate expression for the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta)    
ligand exchange reaction with nickel(cysteine) is.. rate = k(complex) + 
kedta (complex)(edta) . this two-term rate expression is characteristic 
of square planar complexes and agrees with the square planar            
configuration of ni(cysteine) reported on the basis of spectral studies 
the edta-independent term of the rate expression is an acid-catalyzed 
term and can be written k (h) (complex) . the value of kn is 2.5 x 10 m 
sec while the value of kedta is only on the order of 10 -10 m sec . the 
edta reaction with ni(cysteine) methyl ester) is very similar to the    
reaction with ni(cysteine) . when the sulfur-containing amino acid      
ligand contains a thiol ether, the kinetic differences are striking .   
  ligand exchange reactions of edta, triethylenetetramine, and          
diethylenetriamine with nickel-methionine complexes are several orders  
of magnitude faster and give products that are mixed-ligand complexes . 
the results of this kinetic study of amino acid complexes containing    
sulfhydryl and thiol ether sulfur groups support other studies at       
equilibrium which suggest sulfur coordination and square planar         
complexes for the sulfhydryl groups and octahedral complexes with no    
sulfur coordination for thiol ethers .

the action of metal ions on tobacco mosaic virus ribonucleic acid .     
  added transition metal ions stabilize the secondary structure of      
tobacco mosaic virus ribonucleic acid (tmv-rna) as evidenced by a       
reduction in the absorbancy change of heated nucleic acid solutions . in
spite of this stabilization of secondary structure, heating in the      
presence of metal ions results in the loss of biological activity due to
the hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds . thus, all heavy metal ions of  
the iib and first-transition elements studied caused a rapid loss of    
biological activity of tmv-rna at ph 6.5 and 65 . calcium and magnesium 
ions, while not affecting secondary structure at 65 and ph 8.5, caused a
rapid loss of biological activity . at ph 5.8 and room temperature lead 
ions catalyzed the hydrolysis of rna to i'(3')- mononucleotides,. on

  about 700 mice were given throughout their lives 5 ppm cadmium, lead, 
chromium, nickel or titanium in drinking water while fed a diet         
deficient in cadmium and low in other metals . tissue concentrations    
comparable to those of man were observed . sex differences appeared .   
mortality of females was unaffected . mortality of males on cadmium,    
lead and nickel was increased compared with that of the chromium group, 
and of those on cadmium and lead compared with the controls . longevity 
of the oldest 10 of both sexes was less in lead and titanium groups, and
of males in cadmium group, compared with controls . no metal was        
carcinogenic,. incidence of tumors in males on cadmium and lead, and in 
females given nickel was decreased . body weights at death were greater 
in titanium, chromium and lead groups . large increments of titanium,   
moderate increments of cadmium and nickel, and lesser increments of     
chromium and lead were observed in 5 organs, compared with controls .   
higher concentrations of cadmium and titanium occurred in younger mice  
and the other metals did not increase markedly in tissues with age . all

the compounds were toxic, as evidenced by sudden death or subcutaneous

responses of b. subtilis (atcc 558) to streptomycin .                   
  to observe in detail the influence of streptomycin on the growth of sm
dependent type, the author chose b. subtilis (atcc 558) and made        
experiments on its responses to streptomycin, with special reference to 
the relation of the sm concentration with spore formation of its sm     
dependent type together with germination and outgrowth of the spores    
formed . the results are as follows .                                   
  1. among 18x10 cells of wild type of b. subtilis (atcc 558) about     
3,200 cells of sm resistant and one cell of sm dependent are found as   
its mutant .                                                            
  2. b. substilis (atcc 558) shows normal growth at sm concentration    
below 10 r/ml, but the growth declines rapidly between sm 10 r/ml-20 r/m
l, and the growth stops entirely at sm concentration 20 r/ml .          
  3. sm resistant type grows well between sm 0.1 r/ml-sm 2,000 r/ml, the
growth declines rapidly at about sm 10,000 r/ml .                       
  4. sm dependent type shows normal growth between sm 10,000 r/ml-20 r/m
l, the growth get worth below sm 10 r/ml, and the cell shape elongates  
several times, at sm below 1 r/ml each cell becomes filamentous form and
has several ten times length of normal cell, as if the cells have       
stopped to divide at low sm concentration .                             
  6. the germination and outgrowth of spores of the sm dependent type   
slow down with decline of sm concentration, but the germinated spores   
grow in normal forms until sm concentration reaches 7.8 r/ml, then the  
germination becomes much slower, and the cells grow in filamentous forms
or irregular forms . at extremely low sm concentration both germination 
and outgrowth nearly stop .

seventh moiety represented by a smear of material moved toward the anode
one millimeter times five tenths millimeter plugs were removed from   
each of these areas and were placed into freshly lentectomized eyes .   
plugs from most strongly positive and most weakly negative proteins     
inhibited lens regeneration . in addition, plugs from the area          
containing the weakly negative protein induced either lenses with       
aberrant polarity or double centered lenses with centers of opposed     
polarity . all other protein bands had no significant effect on

double-stranded structure by escherichia coli dna polymerase . the rate

appearance in electron micrographs, cscl density-gradient analysis,     
denaturability and genetic activity . dna synthesis which follows the   
repair phase produces a structure that is not covalently linked to the  
primer and resembles, in its nondenaturability, branched appearance, and
lack of genetic activity, the product obtained with a native dna primer

  the molecular fate of transforming dna in competent bacillus subtilis 
has been studied . the physical differentiation of transforming dna and 
the genetic material of recipient bacteria was effected by employing the
isotopes n and p . competent bacteria labeled with n and p were allowed 
to incorporate n p-labeled transforming dna intracellularly . dna was   
isolated from these recipient cells and centrifuged in cesium chloride .
analysis of drop fractions collected at equilibrium showed the presence 
of radioactivity in a region of density corresponding to recipient dna .
material contribution from donor dna to the resident dna did not occur  
when genetically inert bacillus cereus dna was substituted for          
homologous dna . it was concluded that radioactivity appearing in the   
unlabeled resident dna was not the result of degradation of input (     
p)dna and subsequent incorporation by normal metabolic processes . since
single-stranded dna of donor origin was not detected, nor was there     
evidence for the non-specific aggregation of donor and recipient dna, it
was concluded that the observed physical association of transforming and
recipient dna occurs as a result of genetic recombination in transformed
b. subtilis .

bacillus subtilis transforming dna treated by low ph, nitrous acid, or  
hydroxylamine at different temperatures . the frequency of mutants      
increased linearly with time for all three agents, whereas the logarithm
of survival gave a linear plot only for nitrous acid and low ph . an    
arrhenius plot showed the same slopes for both inactivation and mutation
rates after treatment with low ph or nitrous acid,. for the latter agent
the slope remained unaltered even when the dna was treated in the

plasma 17-hydroxycorticosteroids and 17-oxosteroids in patients with    
breast cancer and in normal women .                                     
  (1) 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (17-ohcs) and 17-oxosteroids were       
measured in the plasma of normal women, patients with early breast      
cancer and in patients with advanced metastatic disease .               
  (2) the mean plasma 17-ohcs level was found to be normal in the early 
stages of the disease but was raised in the advanced disease . in both  
groups of patients the variance was significantly greater than in normal
women .                                                                 
  (3) the mean plasma 17-oxosteroid level in both early and advanced    
breast cancer was not significantly different from the normal level but 
the variance was increased .                                            
  (4) there is a significant correlation between the plasma 17-ohcs and 
17-oxosteroids in normal women which was not found in the cancer        
patients .                                                              
  (5) in patients with advanced breast cancer, the levels of plasma 17- 
oxosteroids were significantly correlated with the amounts of 11-deoxy- 
17-oxosteroids found in the urine . there was no correlation between    
plasma and urinary 17-ohcs .                                            
  (6) the physiological significance of these findings is discussed .

hormone therapy in metastatic breast cancer.. clinical response and     
urinary gonadotrophins .                                                
  the total urinary gonadotrophin output of a group of post menopausal  
women with metastatic breast carcinoma undergoing hormone therapy, which
in every case initially consisted of treatment with diethylstilboestrol,
des (ca. 20 mg/d), has been studied for periods varying from seven      
months to 31/2 years .                                                  
  no correlation between gonadotrophin output and clinical response was 
found, except that in all cases showing objective regression urinary    
gonadotrophin remained low throughout the remission period . a low level
of gonadotrophin output was not, however, necessarily indicative of a   
good clinical remission . following withdrawal of des, and independent  
of the period of therapy, recovery to pre-treatment levels was the rule 
rather than the exception .                                             
  a small group of patients maintained on a lower dose of des (3-5 mg/d)
showed the same degree of suppression of urinary output as those        
receiving 20 mg/d, and several of these exhibited objective remissions .
  the study has emphasised the importance of site specificity in the    
response to hormone therapy, and underlines the difficulties of relating
the clinical response of the patient as a whole to changes in hormonal  
environment .

plasma androgens in women i. normal and non-hirsute females,            
oophorectomized and adrenalectomized patients .                         
  1. in a group of 20 normal non-hirsute females age 17 to 38, 18 non-  
hirsute patients with varied genito-urinary disorders, 8 oophorectomized
and or adrenalectomized patients plasma testosterone was measured by the
method of finkelstein et al. (1961) . conjugated androsterone and       
conjugated dhea were determined by a modified method of migeon + plager 
(1955) .                                                                
  2. mean baseline values in normal females were .11 .06 ug/100 ml      
testosterone, 11.8 5.5 ug/100 ml conjugated androsterone, and 29.5 15.5 
ug/100 ml conjugated dhea . no significant response to hcg could be seen
dexamethasone affected the conjugated dhea significantly, but did not 
seem to affect conjugated androsterone or testosterone .                
  3. the non-hirsute patients showed essentially the same pattern . an  
effect of dexamethasone on the levels of conjugated androsterone was    
demonstrated .                                                          
  4. oophorectomized women had baseline values for the conjugates in the
range of normals . testosterone, however, was low with an average of    
 .016 ug/100 ml . in the adrenalectomized patients no androgens were     
detectable .
