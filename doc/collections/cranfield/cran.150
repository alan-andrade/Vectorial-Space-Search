experimental investigation of the aerodynamics of a
wing in a slipstream .
  an experimental study of a wing in a propeller slipstream was
made in order to determine the spanwise distribution of the lift
increase due to slipstream at different angles of attack of the wing
and at different free stream to slipstream velocity ratios .  the
results were intended in part as an evaluation basis for different
theoretical treatments of this problem .
  the comparative span loading curves, together with
supporting evidence, showed that a substantial part of the lift increment
produced by the slipstream was due to a /destalling/ or
boundary-layer-control effect .  the integrated remaining lift
increment, after subtracting this destalling lift, was found to agree
well with a potential flow theory .
  an empirical evaluation of the destalling effects was made for
the specific configuration of the experiment .

simple shear flow past a flat plate in an incompressible fluid of small
viscosity .
in the study of high-speed viscous flow past a two-dimensional body it
is usually necessary to consider a curved shock wave emitting from the
nose or leading edge of the body .  consequently, there exists an
inviscid rotational flow region between the shock wave and the boundary
layer .  such a situation arises, for instance, in the study of the
hypersonic viscous flow past a flat plate .  the situation is somewhat
different from prandtl's classical boundary-layer problem . in prandtl's
original problem the inviscid free stream outside the boundary layer is
irrotational while in a hypersonic boundary-layer problem the inviscid
free stream must be considered as rotational .  the possible effects of
vorticity have been recently discussed by ferri and libby .  in the
present paper, the simple shear flow past a flat plate in a fluid of small
viscosity is investigated .  it can be shown that this problem can again
be treated by the boundary-layer approximation, the only novel feature
being that the free stream has a constant vorticity .  the discussion
here is restricted to two-dimensional incompressible steady flow .

the effect of controlled three-dimensional roughness
on boundary layer transition at supersonic speeds .
  experiments were performed in the 12-in. supersonic wind
tunnel of the jet propulsion laboratory of the california
institute of technology to investigate the effect of three-dimensional
roughness elements (spheres) on boundary-layer transition on a
tained at local mach numbers of 1.90, 2.71, and 3.67 by varying
trip size, position, spacing, and reynolds number per inch .
the results indicate that (1) transition from laminar to turbulent
flow induced by three-dimensional roughness elements begins
when the double row of spiral vortices trailing each element
contaminates and breaks down the surrounding field of vorticity, (2)
transition appears rather suddenly, becoming more violent with
increasing roughness height relative to the boundary-layer
thickness, (3) after the breakdown of the vorticity field, the strength
of the spiral vortices may still persist in the sublayer of the
ensuing turbulent flow, (4) lateral spacing of roughness elements has
little effect upon the initial breakdown (contamination) of the
laminar flow, and (5) the trip reynolds number where u
and v are the velocity and kinematic viscosity at the outer edge of
the boundary layer and k is roughness height, such that transition
occurs at the roughness position, varies as the position reynolds
number to the one-fourth power, viz., where x is
trip position .

  an investigation of transition and skin friction on an insulated
flat plate, 5 by 26 in., was made in the galcit 5 by 5 in.
hypersonic wind tunnel at a nominal mach number of 5.8 .
  the phosphorescent lacquer technique was used for transition
detection and was found to be in good agreement with total-head
rake measurements along the plate surface and pitot boundary-
layer surveys .  it was found that the boundary layer was
laminar at reynolds numbers of at least 5 x 10 .  transverse
contamination caused by the turbulent boundary layer on the
tunnel sidewall originated far downstream of the flat plate leading
edge at reynolds numbers of 1.5 to 2 x 10, and spread at a
uniform angle of 5 compared to 9 degree in low-speed flow .
  the effect of two-dimensional and local disturbances was
investigated .  the technique of air injection into the boundary
layer as a means of hastening transition was extensively used .
although the onset of transition occurred at reynolds numbers
as low as 10, a fully developed turbulent boundary layer was
not obtained at reynolds numbers much below 2 x 10
regardless of the amount of air injected .
  a qualitative discussion of these results is given with emphasis
on the possibility of a greater stability of the laminar boundary
layer in hypersonic flow than at lower speeds .
  direct skin-friction measurements were made by means of the
floating element technique, over a range of reynolds numbers
verified as being laminar over the complete range .  with air
injection, turbulent shear was obtained only for reynolds
numbers greater than 2 x 10, this value being in good agreement with
earlier results of this investigation .  the turbulent skin-friction
coefficient was found to be approximately 0.40 of that for
incompressible flow for a constant value of r, and 0.46 for an effective
reynolds number between 5 and 6 x 10 .

this fact leads to the result that the stresses in the heated plate

application of this analog theory to solid wings under aerodynamic
heating is discussed in detail .  the loading on the unheated analog

piston theory - a new aerodynamic tool for the
aeroelastician .
  representative applications are described which illustrate the
extent to which simplifications in the solutions of high-speed
unsteady aeroelastic problems can be achieved through the use of
certain aerodynamic techniques known collectively as /piston
theory ./  based on a physical model originally proposed by
hayes and lighthill, piston theory for airfoils and finite wings
has been systematically developed by landahl, utilizing
expansions in powers of the thickness ratio and the inverse of the
flight mach number m .  when contributions of orders and
are negligible, the theory predicts a point-function
relationship between the local pressure on the surface of a wing and the
normal component of fluid velocity produced by the wing's
motion .  the computation of generalized forces in aeroelastic
equations, such as the flutter determinant, is then always
reduced to elementary integrations of the assumed modes of motion .
  essentially closed-form solutions are given for the bending-
torsion and control-surface flutter properties of typical section
airfoils at high mach numbers .  these agree well with results of
more exact theories wherever comparisons can be fairly made .
moreover, they demonstrate the increasingly important influence
of thickness and profile shape as m grows larger, a discovery that
would be almost impossible using other available aerodynamic
tools .  the complexity of more practical flutter analyses-e.g., on
three-dimensional wings and panels-is shown to be substantially
reduced by piston theory .  an iterative procedure is outlined, by
which improved flutter eigenvalues can be found through the
successive introduction of higher-order terms in and  .
  other applications to unsteady supersonic problems are
reviewed, including gust response and rapid maneuvers of elastic
aircraft .  steady-state aeroelastic calculations are also discussed,
but for them piston theory amounts only to a slight modification
of ackeret's formulas .
  suggestions are made regarding future research based on the
new aerodynamic method, with particular emphasis on areas where
computational labor can be reduced with a minimum loss of
precision .  it is pointed out that a mach number zone exists where
thermal effects are appreciable but nonlinear viscous interactions
may be neglected, and that in this zone piston theory is the logical
way of estimating air loads when analyzing aerodynamic-
thermoelastic interaction problems .

that the explicit relation between the viscosity and temperature
is not required .  a key point in the analysis is the modification
of the stream function to include a mean of the fluctuating
components and the postulate that the apparent turbulent shear,
associated with an elemental mass, remains invariant in the
transformation .
  the values of the incompressible friction coefficients and of
pressure rise causing separation thus transformed show good
agreement with the experimentally measured and independently

in connection with a study of the wakes behind bodies in hypersonic flow
carried out for the missile and space vehicle division of the general

axisymmetric, compressible wakes .  because of the lack of applicable
experimental data, it was found necessary to make such an estimate by
rationally extending the few available data for incompressible flows to
the compressible case .  this suggested the application and extension of
the transformations applied to turbulent boundary layers in reference
infinitesimal mass are invariant with transformation, mager showed that
the partial differential equations for the compressible turbulent
boundary layer can be transformed to incompressible form .  the validity of
this assumption and of the transformations was established for several

theory of stagnation point heat transfer in dissociated

  the boundary-layer equations are developed in general for the
case of very high speed flight where the external flow is in a
dissociated state .  in particular the effects of diffusion and of atom
recombination in the boundary layer are included .  it is shown
that at the stagnation point the equations can be reduced exactly
to a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations even when the
chemical reactions proceed so slowly that the boundary layer is
not in thermochemical equilibrium .
  two methods of numerical solution of these stagnation point
equations are presented, one for the equilibrium case and the
other for the nonequilibrium case .  numerical results are
correlated in terms of the parameters entering the numerical
formulation so as not to depend critically on the physical assumptions
made .
  for the nonequilibrium boundary layer, both catalytic (to
atom recombination) and noncatalytic wall surfaces are
considered .  a solution is represented which shows the transition
from the /frozen/ boundary layer (very slow recombination
rates) to the equilibrium boundary layer (fast recombination rates) .
a recombination rate parameter is introduced to interpret the
nonequilibrium results, and it is shown that a scale factor is
involved in relating the equilibrium state of a boundary layer on
bodies of different sizes .
  it is concluded that the heat transfer through the equilibrium
stagnation point boundary layer can be computed accurately by
a simple correlation formula and that the heat
transfer is almost unaffected by a nonequilibrium state of the
boundary layer provided the wall is catalytic and the lewis
number near unity .

inviscid hypersonic flow over blunt-nosed slender bodies .
  at hypersonic speeds the drag area of a blunt nose is much
larger than the drag area of a slender afterbody, and the energy
contained in the flow field in a plane at right angles to the flight
direction is nearly constant over a downstream distance many
times greater than the characteristic nose dimension .  the
transverse flow field exhibits certain similarity properties directly
analogous to the flow similarity behind an intense blast wave
found by g. i. taylor, s. c. lin, and a. sakurai .  a comparison
with the experiments of hammitt, vas, and bogdonoff on a
flat plate with a blunt leading edge at in helium shows
that the shock-wave shape is predicted very accurately by this
similarity analysis .  the predicted surface pressure distribution
is somewhat less satisfactory .  experimental results on a
hemisphere-cylinder obtained at in the galcit air tunnel
indicate that not only the shock-wave shape but also the surface
pressures for this body are given very closely by the similarity
theory, except near the hemisphere-cylinder junction .
  energy considerations combined with a detailed study of the
equations of motion show that flow similarity is also possible for
a class of bodies of the form, provided that,
where for a two-dimensional body and for a
body of revolution .  when the shock shape is not
similar to the body shape, and the entire flow field some
distance from the nose must depend to some extent on the details
of the nose geometry .
  by again utilizing energy and drag considerations one finds
that at hypersonic speeds the inviscid surface pressures
generated by a blunt leading edge are larger than the pressures
induced by boundary-layer growth on an insulated flat surface
for an insulated blunt-nosed slender body of revolution the
corresponding distance is given by .  (here
is free-stream reynolds number based on leading-edge
thickness, or nose diameter .)  in free flight these constants are
replaced by 1,700 and 20, respectively, so that viscous
interaction effects are important over the forward portion of a blunt-
nosed slender body only for relatively low values of .

the dynamic motion of a missile descending through
the atmosphere .
  a method is presented for computing rapidly, yet accurately,
the dynamic motion of a ballistic-type missile descending through
the atmosphere .  the equations of motion are separated into a
set of /static/ trajectory equations (zero angle of attack) and a
set of /rotational/ equations describing the oscillatory motion
of the missile about its center of gravity .  a transformation
allows the rotational equations to be written in a manner
analogous to the equation for an undamped oscillating spring mass
system with the mass equal to unity and a time variable spring
constant .  for given initial conditions this equation can be
solved to obtain the envelope of maximum angle of attack .  an
additional transformation allows the calculation of the complete
oscillatory motion at any time during the trajectory as a function
of the maximum angle of attack at that time .
  this solution shows that the maximum angle of attack of a
missile descending through the atmosphere at relatively constant
speed is reduced even when the aerodynamic damping is neglected .

the prospects for magneto-aerodynamics .
  the equations describing the flow of an electrically conducting
fluid in the presence of electric and magnetic fields are written
down with the aid of certain simplifications appropriate to
aeronautical applications .  in order to estimate the probable
significance of magneto-aerodynamic effects, some data on
conductivity of pure and /seeded/ air are first examined .
dimensionless quantities representing the ratios of forces and of
currents are then formed and their values studied for conditions
of flight in the atmosphere .
  some examples of magneto-hydrodynamic and magneto-
gasdynamic effects in simple flows are given .  these include
two cases of poiscuille flow of conducting liquids with applied
magnetic fields and the case of quasi-one-dimensional gas flow
with applied electrical and magnetic fields .  in the last case,
attractive possibilities are found for controlled acceleration or
deceleration of gas at subsonic and supersonic speeds, even in
constant-area channels .  the behavior of the flow is
characteristically different in different regimes of mach number and flow
speed relative to certain /significant speeds/ that are dependent
on the ratio of electrical to magnetic field strengths .  these
are studied, and a chart is constructed to relate the length to
the speed ratio of a maximum-acceleration constant-area channel .
  it is concluded that the advantages that may accrue from
magneto-aerodynamic methods are sufficiently attractive to
justify the considerable research and engineering development
that will be required .  among the unsolved engineering problems
are the reduction of surface resistance of electrodes in contact
with a conducting gas, development of techniques for seeding,
and provision of the required magnetic fields in flight .

constant-temperature magneto-gasdynamic channel flow .
in the course of investigating boundary-layer flow in
continuous plasma accelerators with crossed electric and
magnetic fields, it was found advantageous to have at hand simple
closed-form solutions for the magneto-gasdynamic flow in the
duct which could serve as free-stream conditions for the boundary
layers .  nontrivial solutions of this sort are not available at
present, and in fact, as in the work of resler and sears, the
variation of conditions along the flow axis must be obtained
through numerical integration .
  consequently, some simple solutions of magneto-gasdynamic
channel flow were sought, possessing sufficient algebraic simplicity
to serve as free-stream boundary conditions for analytic
investigations of the boundary layer in a physically reasonable accelerator .
in particular, since the cooling of the accelerator tube is likely to
be an important physical problem because of the high gas
temperatures required to provide sufficient gaseous conductivity,
channel flow with constant temperature appears interesting .
some simple algebraic solutions for the case of a constant
temperature plasma are developed in the following paragraphs .

who used a slightly different approach .  it is demonstrated that

hence be considered a basis for constructing less restricted
solutions .
  equations are presented giving velocity, pressure, detachment
distance, and vorticity .  the values of shock detachment
distance and body pressure coefficient are compared with
experimental data for spheres .  the pressure comparison shows that
the results of hayes and the theory presented herein represent a

hypersonic mach numbers .

the newtonian theory of impact has been shown to be
useful for pressure calculations on the forward facing part
of bodies moving at high speed .  it is now a familiar practice
to use this information to calculate nonviscous velocities at the
wall and then to estimate rates of heat transfer .  this
procedure is perhaps open to question,. heat-transfer rates depend
on velocity gradients which are not given by the newtonian
analysis .  nor can one obtain information on boundary-layer
stability or all the body stability derivatives .  it seems,
therefore, inevitable that, as design proceeds with these hypersonic
missiles, there will be a greater need for more accurate
aerodynamic theories either to predict what will happen in unfamiliar
flight conditions or to effect an extrapolation from a known test
result to the design condition .

a new technique for investigating heat transfer and
surface phenomena under hypersonic flow conditions .
on the forebody of many practically interesting hypersonic
vehicles, there is little interaction between the inviscid
flow field and the boundary layer .  therefore, inviscid flow theory
can be used to determine, independent of surface phenomena,
the physically interesting quantities such as shock shape, shock
detachment distance, sonic line shape, and pressure distribution .
furthermore, the pressure distribution so determined can then be
used for the study of heat transfer, materials behavior, and other
surface phenomena .  thus, for these bodies, the prandtl
boundary-layer concept can be utilized for the calculation of both the
inviscid flow and the boundary-layer behavior .
  it is the purpose of this note to point out that this concept can
also be applied experimentally in order to provide, in
conjunction with a conventional hypersonic wind-tunnel air supply, a
means for investigating hypersonic heat transfer and surface
phenomena under conditions of flight reynolds numbers .

on the flow of a sonic stream past an airfoil surface .
  this study of the flow about an airfoil in a near-sonic stream
indicates the important factors determining the pressure
distribution on the airfoil .  analysis of the mach wave pattern
suggests that the supersonic domain of the flow can be derived
from two simple-wave flows, one arising from the mach waves
reflected at the sonic line and the other from the changes in
airfoil surface slope .  the compressive effect of the reflected mach
waves is determined quantitatively as a function of airfoil
leading-edge geometry from an analysis of measured pressure
distributions for uncambered airfoils,. and it is shown how this can
be superimposed on the wave system from the curved surface to
give an equivalent simple-wave flow over the airfoil .
  an application of this scheme to the calculation of the pressure
distribution over an airfoil in a sonic stream gives results in good
agreement with experiment .

cooling were investigated at test section mach numbers of 1.97,
smooth cone in the presence of three levels of supply-stream
turbulence (0.4, 2, and 9 per cent) and several single-element
roughnesses at fixed axial location .  transition data were obtained
optically by means of a magnified-schlieren system .  the results,
for the range of mach number investigated, indicate that (1)
transition on a smooth cone can definitely be delayed by surface
cooling, (2) transition promoted by either supply-stream
turbulence or surface roughness can also be delayed by surface cooling
depending upon degree of turbulence or relative roughness
respectively, and (3) the adverse effects of increased turbulence and
roughness decrease with increasing mach number .

the gyroscopic effect of a rigid rotating propeller
on engine and wing vibration modes .
  in many wing vibration analyses it is found necessary to take
into account the effect of flexibly mounted engines .  hence,
it is reasonable to ask what vibratory gyroscopic effect this
flexibility may give rise to when propellers are whirling .  an engine
mount may be thought of as a horizontal beam cantilevered
from the wing, having both horizontal and vertical flexibility .
if this beam were infinitely rigid horizontally, then, when it
vibrated, the gyroscopic moments induced in the propeller due
to the resultant pitching motion of its axis would not produce
propeller axis yaw .  however, engine-mount lateral stiffness
tical stiffness, so that gyroscopic effects will play a role as the
propeller axis undergoes pitching vibrations at the tip of the
cantilever engine mount .  the purpose of this paper is to
investigate this role under the assumption that the propeller itself
is a rigid disc .
  the paper is divided into four parts .  part (1) deals briefly
with classical gyroscope theory .  part (2) presents engine
vibration mode studies-experimental photographic techniques on a
model gyroscope mounted at the ends of two different cantilever
beams .  part (3) presents the theory of the coupled motion of
an elastic wing upon which a gyroscope is mounted to simulate
an engine-propeller system on an airplane .  part (4) consists
of an example of the theory of part (3), in which, by taking
what are thought to be reasonable parameters, results are
obtained showing how the whirling of a rigid propeller may
materially affect wing normal mode shapes and frequencies .

effectiveness of roughness due to wall cooling was not sufficient to
explain the transition-reversal phenomenon on nominally smooth

taken to be and in the other values of as low as
eter is a reynolds number formed from velocity and
kinematic viscosity based on calculated conditions at the height of
roughness element k in the undisturbed, laminar boundary layer
at the station of roughness location .  the present note is

tip-bluntness effects on cone pressures at m=6.85 .
there is, at present, considerable interest in the
characteristies of blunted bodies from both an aerodynamic and a
heat-transfer standpoint .  the use of blunt shapes is
contemplated to reduce the heat-transfer problem at body noses, but
there are also applications for blunt noses which occur from
mainly aerodynamic considerations .  an actual reduction in
drag may be the beneficial result of blunting the nose of a cone
or a similar slender shape under certain conditions .  although
the sphere has received considerable treatment, the nose shapes
are not necessarily tangent spheres .  in the case, let us say, of a
total head tube situated in the nose of a given body, the blunting
may be quite flat, and nose sections blunter than spherical shape
may conceivably be desirable, in some cases, from the heat-
transfer standpoint .
  the purpose of the present investigation is to examine the
aerodynamic effect of a simple type of nose blunting on a basic
body .
the incompressible flow of an electrically conducting fluid
past a porous plate y = 0 with constant suction velocity in
the presence of a transverse uniform strength has recently
been investigated by gupta .  in this note, the problem is
generalized to take into account the effect of free convection, when a
body force g per unit mass is acting in the negative x-direction
parallel to the wall .  the fluid is assumed to be semi-
incompressible as usual .  in addition to the obvious practical
significance, this problem is also interesting in the sense that it
provides another exact solution of the magnetohydrodynamic
equations, since the only electromagnetic assumptions involved
are constant properties and freedom from excessive charges .

analysis of low-aspect-ratio aircraft structures .
  two methods are presented for the analysis of complex low-
aspect-ratio aircraft structures .  both methods provide for
arbitrary external loading, are general with respect to the
orientation of structural members, and permit arbitrary boundary
conditions .  for purposes of analysis a structure is idealized as a
network of flexural members with interconnected torsion boxes .
  in the first method, sets of linear equations are obtained by
expressing boundary conditions, member deflection equations,
equilibrium requirements, and slope-compatibility relationships
in terms of deflections and internal forces .  the solution for
deflections and internal forces is then formed as the product of an
inverse structural matrix and a column matrix of load functions .
  in the second method, the conditions at a given boundary are
assembled as a column matrix and are transferred in a step
by-step fashion over the entire structure to an opposite boundary .
the transfer is accomplished by successive multiplications of
square matrices composed independently for the different
transfer ranges .  the final operation is the inversion of a relatively
small matrix and provides the solution for the unknown boundary
conditions .

  an analysis is presented which enables the temperature
profiles, veiocity profiles, heat transfer, and skin friction to be
calculated for laminar flow over a two-dimensional or axially
symmetric surface without pressure gradient but with an arbitrary
analytic distribution of surface temperature .  the general theory is
applicable to a gas of any prandtl number, although the
numerical results given herein have been computed for air .
the predictions of the theory for the special case of constant
surface temperature are compared with the calculations of crocco .
on the basis of this comparison, it is inferred that the present
theory enables heat-transfer and skin-friction calculations
accurate to within about 5 per cent to be made for flight conditions
up to mach numbers near 5 and to within about 1 or 2 per cent
for supersonic wind-tunnel conditions up to considerably higher
mach numbers .
  a particular effort has been made to present the results, which
are simple considering their generality, in a form that can be used
readily in practical applications .  from the mathematical point
of view, the theory is applicable to an arbitrary analytic
distribution of surface temperature, but in any given practical case it is
necessary that the surface-temperature distribution be
approximated by a polynomial .  the only unknowns in the final
equations developed are the coefficients of this polynomial, so that the
work involved in applying the theory in any given case depends
entirely on the work involved in approximating a given surface-
temperature distribution by a polynomial .
  an example is worked out in detail which illustrates some of the
principal effects of variable surface temperature .  it is shown
that both positively infinite and negatively infinite heat-transfer
coefficients can occur .  the anomaly of infinite and negative
heat-transfer coefficients is discussed and attributed to the
customary definition of the heat-transfer coefficient, which is shown
to be fundamentally inappropriate for flows with variable surface
temperature .  in the particular example considered, a
conventional method for calculating the net heat transferred yields
completely incorrect results .  a brief qualitative discussion of the
possible effects of the heat transfer on flow separation is given .
in order to facilitate the use of the results, all of the principal
equations developed are collected and summarized in the section

that the coefficient of viscosity varies linearly with the temperature .
a general approximate solution which permits a rapid determination of

separation, stability and other properties of compressible
laminar boundary layer with pressure gradient and heat
transfer .
  a theoretical study is made of the effect of pressure gradient,
wall temperature, and mach number on laminar boundary-layer
characteristics and, in particular, on the skin-friction and heat-transfer
coefficients, on the separation point in an adverse pressure gradient,
on the wall temperature required for complete stabilization of the
laminar boundary layer, and on the minimum critical reynolds number for
laminar stability .  the prandtl number is assumed to be unity and the
coefficient of viscosity is assumed to be proportional to the
temperature, with a factor arising from the sutherland relation .  a simple and
accurate method of locating the separation point in a compressible flow
with heat transfer is developed .  numerical examples to illustrate the
results in detail are given throughout .

an analysis of the applicability of the hypersonic
similarity law to the study of the flow about bodies
of revolution at zero angle of attack .
  the hypersonic similarity law as derived by tsien has been
investigated by comparing the pressure distributions along bodies of
revolution at zero angle of attack .  in making
these comparisons, particular
attention was given to determining the limits of mach number and fineness
ratio for which the similarity law applies .  for the purpose of this
investigation, pressure distributions
determined by the method of
characteristics for ogive cylinders for
values of mach numbers and fineness
ratios varying from 1.5 to 12 were compared .
pressures on various cones
and on cone cylinders were also compared in this study .
  the pressure distributions presented demonstrate that the hypersonic
similarity law is applicable over a
wider range of values of mach numbers
and fineness ratios than might be expected from the assumptions made in
the derivation .  this is significant since within the range of
applicability of the law a single pressure
distribution exists for all similarly
shaped bodies for which the ratio of
free-stream mach number to fineness
ratio is constant .  charts are presented
for rapid determination of
pressure distributions over ogive cylinders for any combination of mach
number and fineness ratio within defined limits .

applicability of the hypersonic similarity rule to

  the analysis of technical note 2250, 1950, is extended to include
the effects of flow rotation .  it is
found that the theoretical pressure
distributions over ogive cylinders can be related by the hypersonic
similarity rule with sufficient accuracy for most engineering purposes .
  the error introduced into pressure distributions and drag of ogive
cylinders by ignoring the rotation term in the characteristic equations
is investigated .  it is found that
the influence of the rotation term on
pressure distribution and drag depends only upon the similarity
parameter k (mach number divided by fineness ratio) .
although the error in
drag, due to neglect of the rotation term, is negligible at k=0.5, the
error is about 30 percent at k=2.0 .
  charts are presented for the rapid determination of pressure
distributions for rotational flow over
ogive cylinders for all values of
the similarity parameter between 0.5 and

  measured pressure distributions on cones are compared with modified

pressure behind a normal shock are found .
by combining empirical results
for cylinders normal to the flow with

calculations by this method differ from the
experimental results on sharp cones
by only 2 percent of the stagnation

blunted cones, additional deviations

nose .
  schlieren pictures of the flow show an attached shock on the sharp

  the three partial differential equations of the laminar boundary
layer for two-dimensional steady-state compressible flow have been
transformed into two ordinary differential equations by the method of
pohlhausen, falkner, and skan .  the ordinary equations include
parameters for expressing the simultaneous effects of pressure gradient in
the main-stream flow through a porous wall and property changes in the
fluid due to large temperature differences between the wall and the
free stream .
  a total of 58 cases have been solved numerically by the method of
picard .  the euler number (nondimensional pressure-gradient parameter)
ranges in value from 1 (stagnation-point value) to the negative values
found at the laminar separation points .  three rates of flow through
the porous wall were considered (including the impermeable case where
the flow rate is 0) .  five temperature ratios (stream temperature
divided by wall temperature) were used ..  the uncooled and unheated
case (temperature ratio of 1), two cooled cases (temperature ratios of

the plate or to the fluid .  the
equations are integrated numerically for
the effect of the transverse magnetic

similar solutions for the compressible laminar boundary
layer with heat transfer and pressure gradient .
  stewartson's transformation is applied to the laminar compressible
boundary-layer equations and the
requirement of similarity is introduced,
resulting in a set of ordinary nonlinear differential equations
previously quoted by stewartson, but unsolved .  the requirements of the
system are ..  prandtl number of 1.0, linear viscosity-temperature
relation across the boundary layer, an
isothermal surface, and the particular
distributions of free-stream velocity
consistent with similar solutions .
this system admits axial pressure
gradients of arbitrary magnitude, heat
flux normal to the surface, and arbitrary mach numbers .
  the system of differential equations is transformed to an integral
system, with the velocity ratio as
the independent variable .  for this
system, solutions are found for pressure gradients varying from that
causing separation to the infinitely favorable gradient and for wall
temperatures from absolute zero to twice the free-stream stagnation
temperature .  some solutions for separated flows are also presented .
  for favorable pressure gradients, the solutions are unique .  for
adverse pressure gradients, where the solutions are not unique, two
solutions of the infinite family of possible solutions are identified as
essentially viscid at the outer edge of the boundary layer and the
remainder essentially inviscid .  for
the case of favorable pressure gradients
with heated walls, the velocity within
a portion of the boundary layer is
shown to exceed the local external velocity .
the variation of a reynolds
analogy parameter, which indicates the ratio of skin friction to heat
transfer, is from zero to 7.4 for a surface of temperature twice the
free-stream stagnation temperature, and from zero to 2.8 for a surface
held at absolute zero where the value 2 applies to a flat plate .

variations were made in an aerodynamic

the results, which are presented in nondimensional form, indicate that
decreasing the joint conductivity parameter lowers both the interior
and the average temperature ratios, increases the peak thermal stress
ratios in the skin, and may considerably increase the peak stiffener
stress ratios,. increasing the aerodynamic heat-transfer parameter
decreases the interior and average temperature ratios, increases the
peak skin stress ratios somewhat,
but greatly increases the peak
stiffener stress ratios,. and increasing the ratio of skin width to skin
thickness produces only moderate decreases in the peak skin stress
ratios while moderately increasing the peak stiffener stress ratios .

wave is valid for weak expansions but becomes progressively less
accurate for strong expansion waves .
  the laminar-boundary-layer problem was solved by numerical
integration except for the weak wave case,
which can be solved analytically .
integral (karman-pohlhausen type)
solutions were also obtained to provide
a guide for determining expressions
which accurately represent the
numerical data .  analytical expressions
for various boundary-layer parameters
are presented which agree with the
numerical integrations within 1 percent .
  the turbulent-boundary-layer problem was solved using integral
methods similar to those employed for the
solution of turbulent compressible
flow over a semi-infinite flat plate .
the fluid velocity, relative to
the wall, was assumed to have a
seventh-power profile .  the blasius
equation, relating turbulent skin friction
and boundary-layer thickness, was
utilized in a form which accounted for compressibility .
  consideration of the heat transfer to the wall permitted the wall
surface temperature, behind the wave,

investigation of the stability of the laminar boundary
layer in a compressible fluid .
  in the present report the stability of two-dimensional laminar
flows of a gas is investigated by the method of small perturbations .
the chief emphasis is placed on the case of the laminar boundary layer .
  part 1 of the present report deals with the general mathematical
theory .  the general equations governing one normal mode of the small
velocity and temperature disturbances are derived and studied in great
detail .  it is found that for reynolds numbers of the order of those
encountered in most aerodynamic problems, the temperature disturbances
have only a negligible effect on those particular velocity solutions
which depend primarily on the viscosity coefficient (/viscous
solutions/) .  indeed, the latter are actually of the same form in the
compressible fluid as in the incompressible fluid, at least to the first
approximation .  because of this fact, the mathematical analysis is
greatly simplified .  the final equation determining the characteristic
values of the stability problem depends on the /inviscid solutions/ and
the function of tietjens in a manner very similar to the case of the
incompressible fluid .  the second viscosity coefficient and the
coefficient of heat conductivity do not enter the problem,. only the
ordinary coefficient of viscosity near the solid surface is involved .
  part 2 deals with the limiting case of infinite reynolds numbers .
the study of energy relations is very much emphasized .  it is shown
that the disturbance will gain energy from the main flow if the gradient
of the product of mean density and mean vorticity near the solid surface
has a sign opposite to that near the outer edge of the boundary layer .
  a general stability criterion has been obtained in terms of the
gradient of the product of density and vorticity, analogous to the
rayleigh-tollmien criterion for the case of an incompressible fluid .
if this gradient vanishes for some value of the velocity ratio of the
main flow exceeding 1-1/m (where m is the free stream mach number) .

a comparative analysis of the performance of long range
hypervelocity vehicles .
  long-range hypervelocity vehicles are studied in terms of their
motion in powered flight, and their motion and aerodynamic heating in
unpowered flight .  powered flight is
analyzed for an idealized propulsion
system which rather closely approaches
present-day rocket motors .
unpowered flight is characterized by a return
to earth along a ballistic, skip,
or glide trajectory .  only those
trajectories are treated which yield the
maximum range for a given velocity at the end of powered flight .
aerodynamic heating is treated in a manner
similar to that employed previously
by the senior authors in studying ballistic missiles (naca tn 4047),
with the exception that radiant as well as convective heat transfer is
considered in connection with glide and skip vehicles .
  the ballistic vehicle is found to be the least efficient of the
several types studied in the sense
that it generally requires the highest
velocity at the end of powered flight in order to attain a given range .
this disadvantage may be offset, however, by reducing convective heat
transfer to the re-entry body through
the artifice of increasing pressure
drag in relation to friction drag - that
is, by using a blunt body .  thus
the kinetic energy required by the vehicle at the end of powered flight
may be reduced by minimizing the mass of coolant material involved .
  the glide vehicle developing lift-drag ratios in the neighborhood
of and greater than 4 is far superior
to the ballistic vehicle in ability
to convert velocity into range .  it has the disadvantage of having far
more heat convected to it,. however, it has the compensating advantage
that this heat can in the main be radiated
back to the atmosphere .
consequently, the mass of coolant material may be kept relatively low .
  the skip vehicle developing lift-drag ratios from about 1 to 4 is
found to be superior to comparable ballistic and glide vehicles in
converting velocity into range .  at
lift-drag ratios below 1 it is found to
be about equal to comparable ballistic
vehicles while at lift-drag ratios

  an analytical investigation is made of a precession-type instability
which can occur in a flexibly supported aircraft-engine-propeller
combination .  by means of an idealized
mathematical model which is comprised
of a rigid power-plant system flexibly
mounted in pitch and yaw to a fixed
backup structure, the conditions required for neutral stability are
determined .  the paper also examines the sensitivity of the stability
boundaries to changes in such parameters
as stiffness, damping, and
asymmetries in the engine mount, propeller
speed, airspeed, mach number,
propeller thrust, and location of pitch and yaw axes .  stability is found
to depend strongly on the damping and stiffness in the system .
  with the use of nondimensional charts theoretical stability
boundaries are compared with experimental results obtained in wind-tunnel
tests of an aeroelastic airplane model .  in general, the theoretical
results, which do not account for wing response, show the same trends
as observed experimentally,. however,
for a given set of conditions
calculated airspeeds for neutral stability
are consistently lower than the
measured values .  evidently, this result is due to the fact that wing
response tends to add damping to the system .

unaffected with moderate cooling .  with extreme cooling, an adverse effect

in particular, the beneficial effects of a favorable pressure gradient
obtained with moderate cooling disappear with extreme cooling, and a

model surface at adiabatic wall temperature and cooled and (2) the
effect of surface cooling on the lateral spread of turbulence .  both
distributed granular-type and single spherical roughness particles were
used, and transition of the boundary layer was determined by hot-wire
anemometers .  the transition-triggering mechanism of the
three-dimensional roughness at supersonic speeds appeared to be the same as
that previously observed at subsonic speeds .  in fact, the critical
value of the roughness reynolds number parameter (that is,
the value at which turbulent spots are initiated by the roughness) was
found to be approximately the same at supersonic and subsonic speeds
when complete local conditions at the top of the roughness, including
density and viscosity, were considered in the formulation of the
roughness reynolds number .  for three-dimensional roughness at a reynolds
number less than its critical value, the roughness introduced no
disturbances of sufficient magnitude to influence transition .  surface
cooling, although providing a theoretical increase in stability to small
disturbances, did not increase to any important extent the value of the
critical roughness reynolds number for three-dimensional roughness
particles .  cooling, therefore, because of its effect on the
boundary-layer thickness, density, and viscosity actually promoted transition due
to existing three-dimensional surface roughness for given mach and
reynolds numbers .  the measured lateral spread of turbulence in the
boundary layer appeared to be unaffected by the increased laminar
stability derived from the surface cooling .

  the flow and heat transfer about a rotating isothermal disk are
re-examined to include the effects of compressibility and property
variations .  if viscous dissipation is neglected,
the compressible problem is
correlated to the incompressible problem by assuming linear variations
of viscosity and thermal conductivity with temperature .  certain
inaccuracies in several previous incompressible solutions are noted and
corrected herein .  the effect of compressibility appears as a
distortion of the normal coordinate and normal velocity component and as
a multiplicative factor in the heat-transfer coefficient, the nusselt
number, and in the expressions for the skin-friction components and

theoretical investigation of the ablation of a glass-type
heat protection shield of varied material properties
at the stagnation point of a re-entering irbm .
  the melting-type heat protection at the stagnation point of a
re-entering irbm is treated by employing homogeneous, opaque, and
nondecomposing glass shields which do not exceed a temperature of
some effects due to variations of the glass properties .  the ballistic
re-entry vehicle has a nose diameter of 0.635 m, a ballistic factor
of 3.5 x 10, a re-entry angle of 124.9 (from the
vertical) at an altitude of 100 km, and a re-entry speed of 4.5 .
the performance of 36 different glass shields with assumed
combinations of material properties is investigated by employing a
calculation method which yields practically exact, transient solutions
for the problem .  as a corollary, results for a certain steady flight
state are also given .  the discussions made it possible to derive
under realistic flight conditions some thermal characteristics for the
employment of thin, or light-weight, glass shields .
  investigation of these hypothetical glass shields leads to the
conclusion that a low thermal conductivity and a high specific heat,
and thus, a small thermal diffusivity are most desirable .  a small
thermal diffusivity yields high surface temperatures, causing a high
radiative heat transfer out of the shield,. and steep temperature
profiles normal to the surface, causing a small thermal penetration across
the shield with little total ablation of the shield .  results show that
for the assumed irbm re-entry, the necessary thickness of the employed
glass shields increases monotonically with thermal diffusivity which is
the only material parameter affecting this thickness .
  a high viscosity level and a high emissivity constant of the
surface of the supposedly opaque shield are also desirable,. although,
these two properties exert a comparatively small influence on the
overall performance when disregarding glass shields with an extremely
low viscosity level .

discussion of solar proton events and manned space
flights .
  as a result of studies made during the
international geophysical year (igy) and the
international geophysical cooperation (igc),
it is known that a considerable fraction of
large solar flares give rise to almost pure
streams of protons which reach the earth and
continue to arrive for as long as 11 days .
the energies of these particles lie within a
very steep spectrum extending from 20 to
least 500 mev .  because of the frequency
of large flares during times of high solar
activity, and owing to the long duration of each
solar proton emission, these particles were
present in detectable intensity near the top
of the earth's atmosphere for about 15 percent
of the time from 1957 to 1960 .  the number
of large flares that accelerated and released
these particles during this three-year period was about 30 .
  the event that began on august 22, 1958
contributed greatly toward the understanding
of the solar and terrestrial sequence of events,
and in addition provided the first
identification of the emitted particles .  a flare on may
of protons in the neighborhood of the earth that
this phenomenon was recognized as an
additional radiation hazard to manned vehicles
in the high atmosphere and in most parts
of the solar system .  the three very intense
events that occurred in july, 1959 further
supported this conclusion, and the possibility
of predicting such events became an
important consideration .  in addition to its value
in the protection of human beings, effective
forecasting clearly would be of great value in
the detailed scientific study of this
phenomenon .
  this paper presents a preliminary
discussion of some aspects of predicting the
arrival of protons at the earth following the
appearance of solar activity features and,
equally important, of forecasting the periods
when this penetrating radiation is unlikely
to occur .

on trails of axisymmetric hypersonic blunt bodies flying

  the trail left in the atmosphere by a body moving at hypersonic
speeds is the subject of theoretical treatment .  the times
required for ionization and dissociation (and their inverse processes)
to go to completion, when compared to the flow times of a gas
particle, are important in determining the observable effects of
hypersonic trails-i.e., emitted thermal radiation and reflection
of electromagnetic waves from the trail .
  in order to simplify the theoretical treatment, the trail is
divided into two regions ..  (1) the expansion-controlled trail,
which treats the behavior of the wake behind the body up to a
point, along the direction of flight, where the pressure decays to
the free-stream value and cooling is controlled principally by the
expansion of the flow, and (2) the conduction-controlled trail,
where the trail cools mainly by diffusion of heat away from the
high-temperature core .
  the influence of the details of the body shape on the
observables are discussed and a simple computational procedure for
the behavior of the conduction-controlled trail is developed based
on integral methods .  results of calculations that assume
thermodynamic equilibrium of the flow field give the values of the
thermodynamic variables in the trail of a sphere, axial
distributions of emitted thermal radiation, and maps of electron density
distribution .  it is shown that the cooling of the
conduction-controlled trail is essentially due to conduction of heat and that
viscous effects are not important .  it is found that this portion
of the trail does not widen as one proceeds downstream .  flight
velocities considered vary between 15,000 and 35,000 ft sec and

  the present article describes an investigation of several types of
separated regions such as blunt-base wakes and cavities formed
in cutouts in the boundaries and ahead of or behind two
dimensional steps in supersonic (mach numbers 2 to 4) and
subsonic flow .  the conditions for the existence, the geometry,
and the pressure field are described in this paper .
  a second article (to be published) will describe investigations of
the internal flow and the heat transfer across such separated
regions .
  it is found that there is a maximum (critical) ratio of the length
of the separated free-shear layer to the depth of the depression
in the boundary beyond which the cavity collapses, leaving
mutually independent separated regions at each protrusion .
this critical length changes greatly upon laminar-turbulent
transition in the oncoming boundary layer,. in either laminar or
turbulent flow it is approximately independent of mach and
reynolds numbers .  a semiempirical correlation predicting the
conditions under which the flow will span a depression of arbitrary
depth is proposed .
  detailed pressure distributions along the boundaries of a
cavity (in turbulent flow) are presented as a function of the ratio
of the cavity length to the critical length, which is found to be
the pertinent similarity parameter .  for short notches
the impact pressure due to the reversal of the inner portion
of the shear layer at recompression tends to thicken the shear
layer and a type of boundary layer-free stream interaction
governs the pressure field .  the pressure in the cavity is nearly
constant and can be higher than free-stream .  in long notches
the shear layer bends inward at separation and
curves back gradually ahead of the recompression point .  the
floor-pressure variation is pronounced and the recovery pressure
at reattachment is small .  the variation of the drag coefficient
with mach number reflects the change from one to the other
mechanism of recompression .
  detailed surveys of the mach-number distributions in a
blunt-body wake and the mixing region behind its throat, as
well as in the shear layer spanning a cutout in a wall, are presented
and analyzed .  it is found that, in general, the assumptions of
the simple supersonic-wake models which rely on a principle of
steady flow with mass conservation in the cavity are not adequate
for cavities in which there is recompression against a boundary .
  results showing the influence of the thickness of the initial
boundary layer (in the range of 0.3 to 3 times the notch depth)
and of the geometry of the notch are also presented .

the transverse curvature effect in compressible axially
symmetric laminar boundary layer flow .
  the viscous transverse curvature effect in compressible axially
symmetric laminar boundary-layer flow has been investigated,
and it is found that the effect is characterized by the parameter
which is essentially the ratio of the boundary-layer thickness
to body radius .  it is shown that the busemann and crocco
integrals of the two-dimensional energy equation for are
still valid for axially symmetric flow in which the transverse
curvature effects are considered .  by a generalization of
mangler's transformation it is then shown that the boundary-layer
equations are reducible to an almost two-dimensional form,
making the analysis simpler for two asymptotic flow regions
characterized by and less than or of the order of unity .
it is with the latter region that the present paper is primarily
concerned, and for this case it is shown that the additional term
in the momentum and energy equations, which differentiates them
from the two-dimensional form, behaves like an external
favorable pressure gradient .
  except for certain special cases it is necessary to obtain the
of the order of unity by means of asymptotic expansions in
ascending powers of a parameter that is small compared to unity
but proportional to .  it is shown how the asymptotic
solutions can be found for (1) the velocity and temperature
distributions for the compressible zero pressure gradient case when the
body shapes are given by and and (2) the
velocity distribution for incompressible flow with an external
velocity of the form past a body given by .  the
zeroth approximation is the mangler result .  for the cases of a
linear external velocity distribution, similar profiles can be found
for all values of .  more generally it is shown that similar
profiles exist if the exponents n and m satisfy the condition that .
here, similar is used in the restricted meaning
that the distributions are derivable from ordinary differential
equations .
  in the case of the cone and cylinder with zero pressure gradient
where the equations have been numerically integrated for,
the first-order correction to the mangler formulation shows that
the effect on both the skin-friction coefficient and heat-transfer
rate can become appreciable in the range where is less than
or of the order of unity .  at a constant, the effects are
increased in magnitude when either the ratio of wall to free-stream
temperature, or mach number, is increased .  also, all other
conditions being equal, for the same value of the skin-friction
coefficient and heat-transfer increase on the cylinder is greater
than that on the cone .
  for flows with pressure gradient, the transverse curvature term
behaves again like a favorable pressure gradient and tends to
delay both separation and transition when compared with axially
symmetric flows in which the transverse curvature effect is
neglected .

a review is presented of the published data on the effect of roughness,
especially single roughness elements, on transition from laminar to
turbulent flow, in which an attempt is made to reanalyze and correlate the
available information .  the reanalysis shows that the transition
reynolds number of a flat plate with zero pressure gradient is a
function of the ratio of the height of the roughness element to the
displacement thickness of the boundary layer at the element, this functional
relation being a better representation of the data than a constant
critical reynolds number of the roughness element .  other data show that the
effects of roghness are similar in streams of different initial
turbulence and that a plot of the ratio of transition reynolds number of the
rough plate to that for the smooth plate against the ratio of the height
of the roughness element to displacement thickness of the boundary layer
at the element gives good correlation of all the data for a given shape
when transition occurs downstream from the
roughness element .  at a certain value of the height-thickness ratio
dependent on the stream speed, location of roughness element, and
airstream turbulence, the transition position reaches the element and
remains there as the height or the stream speed is further increased .
the paper also discusses available data on the effect of distributed
roughness on transition on a flat plate, as well as some of the

treats the general class of flow problems characterized by the
interaction between a viscous or dissipative flow near the surface
of a solid body, or in its wake, and an /outer/ nearly isentropic
stream .  for the present, the external flow is taken to be a plane,
steady, supersonic flow, which makes a small angle with a plane
surface or plane of symmetry, although the methods used can be
extended to curved surfaces, to axially symmetric supersonic
flows, and also to subsonic flows .  the internal dissipative flow
is regarded as quasi-one-dimensional and parallel to the surface
on the average, with a properly defined mean velocity and mean
temperature .  the nonuniformity of the actual velocity
distribution is taken into account only approximately by means of a
relation between mean temperature and mean velocity .
mixing, or the transport of momentum from outer stream to
dissipative flow, is considered to be the fundamental physical process
determining the pressure rise that can be supported by the flow .
with the aid of this concept, a large number of flow problems is
shown to be basically similar, such as boundary-layer
shockwave interaction, wake flow behind blunt-based bodies (base
pressure problem), flow separation in overexpanded supersonic
nozzles, separation on wings and bodies, etc .

the fundamentals of the statistical theory of turbulence .
statistical theory in general considers mean values of certain

values of velocities and of their derivatives, and in mean values of
squares and products of velocities and their derivatives .  it was o.
reynolds who first expressed the so-called apparent or turbulent
stresses by the mean values of the products of the velocity components .  the
different theories suggested so far have as their common objective the
establishment of relations between certain mean values, e.g. between the
turbulent shear stresses given by the mean products of velocity
fluctuations and the derivatives of the mean velocities, i.e. the measured mean
velocity gradients .  in this sort of investigations the conception of
the /correlation/ is of paramount importance .  the late a. friedman
tried to introduce the correlations as unknown variables in the
hydrodynamic equations., however, he could not carry his investigations to
practical results, i.e., to results which can be compared with the
experimental evidence .  recently, g. i. taylor had success in his
analysis of /isotropic/ turbulence by means of correlation calculations, and
was able to discuss, theoretically, the problem of the decay of
turbulence in a windstream behind a turbulence producing device .  his theory
raised considerable interest because it is concerned with the important
problem of wind-tunnel turbulence and its results could be compared
directly with experimental work done by dryden in this country and by
fage, townend and simmons in england .
the present paper is concerned with two fundamental problems.. with
uniform isotropic turbulence and with the turbulent friction in a

vibration in aircraft structure can almost
always be traced to vibratory forces originating
from the power plant .  these forces are transmitted
to the aircraft in two ways ..  (1) by the action of air
forces upon the surfaces of the aircraft in, or adjacent
to, the slip stream of the propeller, and (2) by direct
transmission of unbalanced forces from the power
plant through the engine mounting .  the latter has
always caused the preponderance of disturbance .
vibratory stresses induced in the engine mounting
structure occasionally produce fatigue failures in the
associated parts, and always shorten the useful life
of the entire aircraft structure .  more important,
however, are the psychological and physiological
effects of continuous vibration and its attendant noise
on the passengers and crew .  this may very likely
be the major source of the rapid fatigue which is so
intimately associated with flying .  the importance
and desirability of drastically reducing vibration can
hardly be questioned .
  this paper is limited to a consideration of the
directly transmitted forces and, further, considers the
power plants as rigid bodies attached by flexible means
to the aircraft which is also considered as a rigid body
of relatively large mass .  it is also limited to the case
of engines and engine supporting structures having

laminar heat transfer over blunt-nosed bodies at hypersonic flight
speeds .
this paper deals with two limiting cases of laminar heat transfer over
blunt-nosed bodies at hypersonic flight speeds, or high stagnation
temperatures..  (a) thermodynamic equilibrium, in which the chemical
reaction rates are regarded as /very fast/ compared to the rates of diffusion
across streamlines., (b) diffusion as rate-governing, in which the
volume recombination rates within the boundary layer are /very slow/
compared to diffusion across streamlines .  in either case the gas density
near the surface of a blunt-nosed body is much higher than the density
just outside the boundary layer, and the velocity and stagnation
enthalpy profiles are much less sensitive to pressure gradient than in the
more familiar case of moderate temperature differences .  in fact, in
case (a), the nondimensionalized enthalpy gradient at the surface is
represented very accurately by the /classical/ zero pressure gradient
value, and the surface heat-transfer rate distribution is obtained
directly in terms of the surface pressure distribution .  in order to
illustrate the method, this solution is applied to the special cases
of an unyawed hemisphere and an unyawed, blunt cone capped by a
spherical segment .
in the opposite limiting case where diffusion is rate-controlling the
diffusion equation for each species is reduced to the same form as the
low-speed energy equation, except that the prandtl number is replaced
by the schmidt number .  the simplifications introduced in case (a) are
also applicable here, and the expression for surface heat transfer rate
is similar., the maximum value of the ratio between the rate of heat
transfer by diffusion alone and by heat conduction alone in the case of
thermodynamic equilibrium is given by..  (prandtl no./schmidt no .)
when the diffusion coefficient is estimated by taking a reasonable value
of atom-molecule collision cross section this ratio is 1.30 .
additional theoretical and (especially) experimental studies are clearly

transversely to the fluid motion and is assumed to remain constant
in the direction perpendicular to the plate .  this introduces into
the momentum equation a retarding force which is a function only
of x, the distance along the plate length .  for similarity it is
found that the magnetic inductance must vary as .  if

inductance is constant while the plate temperature increases linearly

the production of uniform shear flow in a wind tunnel .
  a nearly uniform shear flow was obtained in the working
section of a wind tunnel by inserting a grid of parallel rods with
varying spacing .
  the function of such a grid is to impose a resistance to the
flow, so graded across the working section as to produce a linear
variation in the total pressure at large distances downstream
without introducing an appreciable gradient in static pressure near
the grid .  a method of calculating a suitable arrangement of the
rods is described .  although this method is strictly applicable
only to weakly sheared flows, an experiment made with a grid
designed for a shear parameter as large as 0.45 gave results in
close agreement with the theory .  there was no evidence from
the experiment of any large-scale secondary flow accompanying
the shear--a danger inherent in an empirical attempt to grade the
resistance of the grid--nor was any tendency observed for the
shear to decay with increasing distance from the grid .

dynamics of a dissociating gas .
  this is a lucid introduction to the effects of dissociation
in gas dynamics .  the problem in view is that of air flow
past a bluff body at speeds somewhat above 2 km sec .
thermodynamic equilibrium is assumed,. theories of near
equilibrium for transport properties and of large
departures from equilibrium being promised in parts 2 and 3 .
  following a survey of the equilibrium statistical
thermodynamics of a pure dissociating diatomic gas, a
new model is introduced .  this /ideal dissociating gas/ is
characterized by only three constants, the characteristic
temperature, density and internal energy for dissociation .
physically, it may be regarded as having its vibrational
modes always just half excited (so that at low
temperatures the ratio of specific heats approaches 4 3 rather
then 7 5) .  thermodynamic properties of the ideal gas
are derived, and the oblique shock wave relations
deduced in the /strong-shock/ approximation (including an
elegant relation between the principal curvatures of any
bow shock and the subsequent vorticity) .  useful relations
are given for the isentropic changes that take place along
streamlines between shocks .
  various of these results are applied to the problem
typified by a sphere flying at high mach number .  the
newtonian impact theory and its empirical modification
are dismissed as lacking theoretical basis, in favor of the
limit for large values of both mach number and density
ratio across the shock .  it is suggested that the zero
surface pressure sometimes predicted by the latter theory
corresponds to separation not of the flow but of the shock
wave from the surface .  an estimate is given for the
subsequent shape of the shock .  finally, another
approximation is applied to the region near the stagnation
streamline .  the fluid is assumed incompressible, but rotational
in accord with the shock relations,. and it is shown that a
spherical shock corresponds to a concentric spherical body .
the resulting surface pressure is within 1 per cent of that
predicted by freeman's second approximation based on
the newtonian-plus-centrifugal solution (same j. 1 (1956),

along channels in the presence of an imposed

conduct currents .  the equations which determine
the velocity profile, induced currents and
field are derived and solved exactly in the case
of a rectangular channel .  when the imposed
field is sufficiently strong the velocity profile is
found to degenerate into a core of uniform flow
surrounded by boundary layers on each wall .
the layers on the walls parallel to the imposed
field are of a novel character .  an analogous
degenerate solution for channels of any symmetrical
shape is developed .  the predicted pressure
gradients for given volumes of flow at various field
strengths are finally compared with experimental results for square and

not by errors due to finite averaging time and scanning

response of plates to a decaying and convecting randon

  following the methods of lyon, an analysis of the
vibratory response of a plate to a random pressure
field is given .  the pressure correlation of the random
field is assumed to have a scale small compared to
the plate size, to decay exponentially, and to convect
with constant speed over the plate .  two cases are
considered, one in which the convection speed is much
less than the speed of free flexural waves in the plate,
the other in which the convection speed is the same
order as the flexural wave speed .  the mean square plate
displacement is shown to be relatively independent
of convection for speeds much less than the flexural
wave speed, and to increase significantly for speeds in
the order of the flexural wave speed .  it is shown that
damping is usually, but not always, an effective means
of vibration reduction .  in the case of convection
speeds much smaller than the flexural speed, the use of
hysteretic damping for reduction of the displacement
response is shown to be limited by the decay of the
assumed random pressure field .

the paper concerns the hydrodynamic turbulent
motion in the lubricant layer .  proceeding
from the reynolds equations and introducing
the approximations currently used in
lubrication problems, owing to the lubricant film
thickness, the general motion equations for
turbulent lubrication are written .
  using the prandtl mixing length hypothesis,
exact and approximate solutions are
obtained for the velocity distribution into the
lubricant layer .  the results are discussed by
pointing out the pressure gradient and the
reynolds number influence on the velocity
distributions, as well as the differences with
respect to the laminar flow .
  in order to obtain simple formulae, the
exact dependence of the rate of flow on the
pressure gradient into a dimensionless form
is replaced by a linear relation, the slope of
which depends on the reynolds number .
this approximation allows the obtainment of
the pressure differential equation under a
simple form .  the pressure equation is integrated
in case of journal bearings, by assuming a
constant or a variable viscosity of the lubricant .

the elliptic cylinder in a shear flow with hyperbolic

  the stream function for the shear flow with hyperbolic
velocity profile past an elliptic cylinder has been determined
as an infinite series of mathieu functions .  it is found that
the stagnation streamline of the flow is displaced towards
a region of higher velocity, this displacement increasing
the main stream, (2) as the stream becomes progressively
non-uniform, (3) with increase of minor axis length when
the major axis length remains invariant .  in each case the
displacement reaches a limiting value as the cylinder moves away
from the axis of symmetry of the stream .  these limiting
values are reached at critical distances from the axis of symmetry,
which decrease as the stream becomes progressively non-uniform,
but these distances are approximately independent of incidence .
  the pressure coefficients and the resultant force and moment
coefficients associated with the cylinder have also been obtained,
and investigated numerically for the flat plate type of cylinder .

a simplified approximate method for the calculation of the pressure
around conical bodies of arbitrary shape in supersonic and hypersonic

exact conical-flow solutions are available only for circular cones at
zero angle of attack .  for nonaxisymmetric cones or cones at angle of
attack, only approximate methods exist .  these methods are generally
quite complicated and further limited to certain body shapes or certain
mach-number ranges .  a great need was therefore felt for a simple
approximate method applicable to any arbitrarily shaped conical body at
zero incidence as well as at angle of attack .
such a method has been developed recently at lockheed and is presented
here in abbreviated form .  the method is based on the /equivalent-cone/
theory .  this theory determines the pressure on a conical body
utilizing information for a symmetric cone at zero angle of attack with the
same normal component of the free stream with respect to the surface as
the local element of the body considered .  this method works relatively
well at high mach numbers .  however, it is quite inconsistent at lower
mach numbers, especially for bodies which deviate considerably from
circular cones .  the equivalent-cone method does not give satisfactory
results, mainly due to the fact that it considers only the local surface
element on the body independent of the other body elements in the
newtonian-theory manner .

experimental and theoretical means .  two gaseous coolants, nitrogen

half angle of 30 .  the effect of the mass transfer on the shock
shape, pressure distribution, heat transfer, and transition are
investigated .  the experimental work involved tests in the
mach-number-8.0 tunnel at pibal .  the theoretical analysis involved
a study of the effect of mass transfer on the shock stand-off
distance and leads to an inviscid-flow parameter permitting the
experimentally determined shock shape and pressure distribution
to be extrapolated to other than test conditions and to other
coolant gases .  there is obtained the maximum value of this
parameter resulting in no significant alteration of the pressure
distribution on the cone and thus defining the flows in which
boundary-layer-type similarity applies .
  significant reductions in heat transfer are obtained with
injection .  indeed, with small amounts of helium injection the
peak heating is found to occur downstream on the cone and to be
an order of magnitude less than would occur at the stagnation
point without mass transfer .  with nitrogen early transition is
found to occur, so that local heating rates are actually increased

basis for the comparison .  most of the approximate theories
are inadequate except over very limited ranges of fineness ratio
and mach number .  the combination of second-order
supersonic theory and second-order shock-expansion theory provides
consistently good results throughout the supersonic speed range .
  on the basis of exact (or nearly exact) supersonic solutions and
a limited amount of test data and theory in the transonic region,
summary design curves are developed that give the pressure
drag of conical and ogive noses and conical and ogive boattails
over the complete range of transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic
mach numbers .  other shapes can be analyzed in the same
manner, provided that an equivalent amount of data is available .
  the analysis is made with the assumption of inviscid flow,
so that the effects of boundary-layer growth, shock
boundary-layer interaction, and flow separation are not included .  the
present correlations provide a sound basis of inviscid-flow results
from which these additional viscous effects can be evaluated .

were obtained at free-stream mach numbers of 0.3, 0.7, 3.5, and
x 10 with injection of helium, air, and freon-12
through the porous wall .  substantial reductions in skin
friction are realized with gas injection within the range of mach
numbers of this test .  the relative reduction in skin friction is
in accordance with theory--that is, the light gases are most
effective when compared on a mass flow basis .  there is a marked
effect of mach number on the reduction of average skin friction,.
this effect is not shown by the available theories .  limited
transition location measurements indicate that the boundary layer
does not fully trip with gas injection but that the transition point
approaches a forward limit with increasing injection .  the
variation of the skin-friction coefficient, for the lower injection rates
with natural transition, is dependent on the flow reynolds
number and type of injected gas,. and at the high injection rates the
skin friction is in fair agreement with the turbulent
boundary-layer results .

two-dimensional jet mixing of a compressible fluid .
  the mixing and divergence of a supersonic jet exhausting into
a supersonic stream are investigated theoretically .
  in the first part of this paper, the flow is assumed to be laminar .
when the velocity and temperature in the jet are different
slightly from those of the surrounding stream, by the method of
small perturbations and under ordinary boundary layer
assumptions, the equation of motion of two-dimensional flow will be
reduced to a form of the well-known equation of heat conduction,
whose solution is known for any given boundary conditions .  it
has also been shown that the exact solution of the two
dimensional jet mixing of viscous compressible fluids can be obtained
by successive approximations starting with the solution of small
perturbations .
  velocity and temperature distributions for two cases--one is
the mixing of two-uniform flows and the other is the mixing of a
jet of compressible fluid from a two-dimensional nozzle with full
expansion exhausting into a supersonic stream--have been
calculated .  the properties of the jet mixing depend mainly on the
momentum of the jet regardless of whether the change of
momentum is due to the change of velocity or the change of
temperature--i.e., the change of density .  compressibility has a
considerable effect on the properties of the jet .
  in the second part, the cases of turbulent flow are investigated .
by means of reichardt's theory of free turbulence, the turbulent
shearing stress may be expressed as
  it has been shown in this paper that
where is a constant that can be determined experimentally .
the value of n lies between 0 and 1 .  the exact value of n
depends on the condition of mixing .
  when the expression of turbulent shearing stress given above
is used instead of the viscous stress in the equation of motion,
by suitable transformation of variables, it has been shown that
the equation of two-dimensional turbulent jet mixing is identical
to that of the laminar case .  hence, the solution of the first part
of this paper can be applied to the turbulent case, provided that
the characteristic constants and n have been properly chosen .

viscosity effects in sound waves of finite amplitude:

  this article has as its subject /the conflicting influence on
sound propagation of convection on the one hand, and of diffusion
and relaxation on the other/, whose importance in the
determination of the structure of shock waves was first appreciated clearly
by sir geoffrey taylor .  as an essential introduction to the main
topics, author gives an exceptionally clear and valuable account
of the physical mechanisms of viscosity, thermal conductivity, and
other diffusion effects, including relaxation .  the classical theory
of shock-wave formation is then discussed, and some extensions
are made .
  the remainder of the article is based on the demonstration that
the nonlinear equation for plane progressive sound waves, in which
convection and diffusion are taken into account to a first
approximation, can be transformed into burgers's equation, the general
solution of which was given by hopf and cole .  this approach, in
which all flows are continuous (they become discontinuous at
shock waves in the limit as viscosity, etc., tend to zero), allows
the author to re-derive and extend whitham's theory of the
formation and decay of weak plane shock waves, and to derive many
new results, such as the velocity distributions during the union
of two shock waves and during the formation of a shock wave .
the application of the same idea to non-plane shock waves is
also discussed, but more briefly,. in these cases, burgers's
equation is not quite such a good approximation as before .
  the article concludes with sections on sound waves whose
reynolds numbers based on the length scale of the flow and the
velocity amplitude are comparable with unity, and on the effects
of relaxation on the properties of shock waves .  the whole is
much more than a survey, and represents a very substantial
advance in the theory of sound waves .  it is the finest possible
tribute to sir geoffrey taylor that he should be able to inspire
articles such as this and the others in this volume .

some effects of surface curvature on laminar boundary
layer flow .
  the laminar flow of a viscous incompressible fluid over a
two-dimensional curved surface is investigated for two cases, one in
which the curvature is /large/ and the other in which it is
cases are obtained as approximations from the exact equations of
motion by an order-of-magnitude analysis .  these equations are
solved for flow over a particular surface with zero surface pressure
gradient .  in this analysis, the pressure gradient normal to the
surface is included, and the outer boundary conditions are
modified in accordance with the requirements of flow over a curved
surface .
  the results indicate that for equal reynolds numbers, the
stress on convex surfaces is less than the flat-plate value, while
the stress on concave surfaces is greater than for a flat plate .  the
most important effect of surface curvature, for the cases
considered, is the modification of the shape of the velocity profile
near the /outer edge/ of the boundary layer .  the requirement
that a smooth transition exist between the viscous flow and the
potential flow at the outer edge of the layer causes the profile to
have a negative slope near the outer edge for convex surface
curvature and a positive slope for concave surface curvature .

note on an interaction between the boundary layer and the inviscid
flow .
according to the classical boundary-layer theory the flow about bodies
at reynolds numbers of aeronautical interest can be considered as
composed of two regimes..  an outside inviscid flow and a thin
boundary-layer region adjacent to the body .  this point of view leads to the
approximation that, on a slightly curved surface, throughout the layer
is negligibly small .  the additional assumption that the inviscid flow
is irrotational leads to the requirement that is zero at the outer edge
of the boundary layer .  in this theory any interaction between the two
regimes is accountable by a simple correction to the body shape based on
the boundary-layer displacement thickness .
recently, in connection with hypersonic laminar boundary layers, this
classical point of view has been modified., an interaction between the
two flow regimes leading to a self-induced axial pressure gradient has
been considered .  it is the purpose of the present note to point out
another type of interaction which may be of practical importance and of
fundamental interest even at mach numbers below those considered in the
hypersonic boundary-layer theory and which may have to be considered in
that theory .

the calculation of wall shearing stress from heat-transfer measurements
in compressible flows .
it has been shown by ludwieg that the wall shearing stress of a laminar
or turbulent boundary layer in an incompressible flow can be determined
from a heat-transfer measurement at the surface .  the instrument
used in that investigation was essentially a small, locally insulated,
heating element embedded in the test surface .  the size of the
instrument was restricted by the condition that the thermal boundary layer
generated by the heating element be contained locally within the laminar
sublayer .  in the present analysis ludweig's theory for such an
instrument is extended to compressible flow over an insulated flat plate .
with the same limitations on the design and operation of the instrument
as mentioned above, it can also be assumed for compressible laminar
and turbulent boundary layers that only the flow in the immediate
vicinity of the wall or the laminar sublayer will be affected in the region
of the heated element .  this assumption then permits the use of the
laminar boundary-layer equations as the governing equations for this
analysis for both laminar and turbulent boundary layers .

wakes in axial compressors .
the tendency in the past has been to assume that
when wakes or non-uniform total head profiles are
fed into an axial compressor then substantially constant
static pressure prevails at the entry, the variations in total
head appearing as variations in velocity .  this variation
in velocity causes variation in incidence on the early stage
blade rows and thus can give rise to excitation of blade
vibration .  this assumption is implicit, for instance, in
references 1 and 2, but we think has been a common
assumption by most of the people working in this field .
  where the compressor is fed by a duct of substantially
parallel walls for a reasonable length ahead, such an
assumption appeared justifiable .  such a duct when given
an air flow test with its outlet discharging, for instance,
to atmosphere instead of to the compressor, then the
distribution assumed would normally be obtained and in fact
many surveys of such ducts have been represented in this
fashion .  the object of this note is to show that, in fact,
this distribution will not normally occur when the
compressor is present and we may normally expect much more
nearly a constant velocity into the compressor with
attendant static pressure distributions to match with the total
head variations ahead of the intake, with of course, the
attendant curved flow to support the static pressure
gradients .

density of the fluid, and p and v are the static pressure and
velocity in the undisturbed stream .  as found in previous

increase being about at a reynolds number of 50 (based
on external tube radius) .  in disagreement with the work of hurd,

reynolds number .

the determination of turbulent skin friction by means
of pitot tubes .
  a simple method of determining
local turbulent skin friction on a smooth
surface has been developed which utilises a
round pitot tube resting on the surface .
assuming the existence of a region near the
surface in which conditions are functions
only of the skin friction, the relevant physical
constants of the fluid and a suitable length,
a universal non-dimensional relation is
obtained for the difference between the total
pressure recorded by the tube and the static
pressure at the wall, in terms of the skin
friction .  this relation, on this assumption,
is independent of the pressure gradient .
the truth and form of the relation were first
established, to a considerable degree of
accuracy, in a pipe using four geometrically
similar round pitot tubes--the diameter
being taken as representative length .  these four
pitot tubes were then used to determine
the local skin friction coefficient at three stations
on a wind tunnel wall, under varying
conditions of pressure gradient .  at each station,
within the limits of experimental
accuracy, the deduced skin friction coefficient was
found to be the same for each pitot
tube, thus confirming the basic assumption and
leaving little doubt as to the correctness
of the skin friction so found .  pitot traverses
were then made in the pipe and in the
boundary layer on the wind tunnel wall .  the results
were plotted in two non-dimensional
forms on the basis already suggested and they
fell close together in a region whose
outer limit represented the breakdown of the
basic assumption, but close to the wall
the results spread out, due to the unknown
displacement of the effective centre of a
pitot tube near a wall .  this again provides
further evidence of the existence of a
region of local dynamical similarity and of the
correctness of the skin friction deduced
from measurements with round pitot tubes on
the wind tunnel wall .  the extent of the
region in which the local dynamical similarity
may be expected to hold appears to vary
from about to of the boundary-layer
thickness for conditions remote from,
and close to, separation respectively .

supersonic flow past slender bodies with discontinuous
profile slope .
  ward's slender-body theory is extended to derive first
approximations to the external forces on slender
bodies of general cross section
with discontinuous profile slope .  two
classes of body are considered ..
bodies whose profile (typified by the local
radius) is continuous between the
nose and base, and certain bodies whose
profile is discontinuous, such as
bodies with annular or side air intakes and
wing-bodies on which the wing
has an unswept leading edge .  (where air
intakes are concerned, it is
assumed that they are sharp-edged and that
there is no /spillage/ of the
internal flow) .
  the following conclusions apply to
the former class of bodies .  the
variation of drag with mach number is
found to depend only on the
discontinuities in the longitudinal rate of change
of the cross-sectional area, and is
thus independent of cross-sectional shape .
the drag itself is unchanged if
the direction of the flow is reversed .  the
expressions for lift and moment
assume the same forms as for smooth pointed
bodies, the lift depending only
on conditions at the base of the body .
  the general theory is applied to
winged bodies of revolution with an
unswept wing leading edge ..  the results
bear a marked resemblance to those
obtained by ward .  the results for wings
alone are seen to be applicable,
with one modification, to subsonic as well as to supersonic speeds .

distributions which are unlikely to be
seriously affected by viscous effects .
wave drag and pressure distributions
are calculated by slender-wing theory .

surface, we choose x as the velocity potential of the external
flow, and y as a coordinate, constant along the external-flow
streamlines, such that h dy is the distance between (x,y) and
z is the distance from the surface, u and v are the x and y components

expansions at small reynolds number for the flow past

  this paper is concerned with the problem of obtaining higher
approximations to the flow past a sphere and a circular cylinder
than those represented by the well-known solutions of stokes
and oseen .  since the perturbation theory arising from the
consideration of small non-zero reynolds numbers is a singular
one, the problem is largely that of devising suitable techniques for
taking this singularity into account when expanding the solution
for small reynolds numbers .
  the technique adopted is as follows .  separate, locally valid
the regions close to, and far from, the obstacle .  reasons are
presented for believing that these 'stokes' and 'oseen' expansions
are, respectively, of the forms
where are spherical or cylindrical polar coordinates made
dimensionless with the radius of the obstacle, r is the reynolds
number, and and vanish with r .  substitution
of these expansions in the navier-stokes equation then yields a
set of differential equations for the coefficients and, but
only one set of physical boundary conditions is applicable to each
expansion (the no-slip conditions for the stokes expansion, and
the uniform-stream condition for the oseen expansion) so that
unique solutions cannot be derived immediately .  however, the
fact that the two expansions are (in principle) both derived from
the same exact solution leads to a 'matching' procedure which
yields further boundary conditions for each expansion .  it is thus
possible to determine alternately successive terms in each
expansion .
  the leading terms of the expansions are shown to be closely
related to the original solutions of stokes and oseen, and detailed
results for some further terms are obtained .
